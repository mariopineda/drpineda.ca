<p>This WebQuest was designed for students following the Alberta highschool Program of Studies in sciences and prepares students to critically address science-related societal, economic, ethical and environmental issues through group work. The WebQuest integrates several subjects at different grade levels, e.g. <a href="http://education.alberta.ca/media/654833/science10.pdf">Science 10</a>, <a href="http://education.alberta.ca/media/654841/bio203007.pdf">Biology 20-30</a>, <a href="http://education.alberta.ca/media/654849/chem2030_07.pdf">Chemistry 20-30</a> and can also be dovetailed to Social Studies. This WebQuest is suitable as a term-end enrichment project for more academicaly advanced classes. 

<h2>Curriculum Outcomes</h2>
<h3>Science 10 Unit D: Energy Flow in Global Systems</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Students will describe how the relationships among input solar energy, output terrestrial energy and energy flow within the biosphere affect the lives of humans and other species.</li>
  <li>Analyze the relationships among net solar energy, global energy transfer processes—primarily radiation, convection and hydrologic cycle—and climate.</li>
  <li>Relate climate to the characteristics of the world’s major biomes, and compare biomes in different regions of the world.</li>
  <li>Investigate and interpret the role of environmental factors on global energy transfer and climate change.</li>
</ul>
  
<h3>Biology 20-30</h3>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>20–A3.3k</dt>
  <dd>Students will describe the geologic evidence (stromatolites) and scientific explanations for change in atmospheric composition, with respect to oxygen and carbon dioxide, from anoxic conditions to the present, and describe the significance to current biosphere equilibrium.</dd>
  <dt>30–D2.3k</dt>
  <dd>Students will explain how mixtures of populations that define communities may change over time or remain as a climax community; i.e., primary succession, secondary succession.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Chemistry 20-30</h3>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt>30–C1.7k</dt>
<dd>describe, in general terms, the physical, chemical and technological processes (fractional distillation and solvent extraction) used to separate organic compounds from natural mixtures or solutions; e.g., petroleum refining, bitumen recovery.</dd>
  <dt>30–C2.4k</dt>
  <dd>Students will relate the reactions described above to major reactions that produce thermal energy and economically important compounds from fossil fuels.</dd>
  </dl>

<h3>STS</h3>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>20–A1.1sts</dt>
  <dd>Students will explain that the process of scientific investigation includes analyzing evidence and providing explanations based upon scientific theories and concepts </dd>
  <dt>20–A2.1sts</dt>
  <dd>Students will explain that science and technology have both intended and unintended consequences for humans and the environment.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Attitudes & Skills</h3>
In this WebQuest students will;
<ul>
<li>Be encouraged to develop attitudes that support collaborative activity.</li>
<li>Be encouraged to develop responsibility in the application of science and technology in relation to society and the natural environment.</li>
<li>Research the answers to questions they generate</li>
<li>Explore and use a variety of methods and resources to increase their knowledge and skills.</li>
<li>Be critical and constructive when considering new theories and techniques.</li>
<li>Use scientific vocabulary and principles in everyday discussions.</li>
<li>Recognize the usefulness of being skilled in mathematics and problem solving.</li>
<li>Be interested in science and technology topics not directly related to their formal studies.</li>
<li>Recognize the importance of making connections among various science disciplines.</li>
<li>Maintain interest in pursuing further studies in science.</li>
<li>Explore where further science- and technology-related studies and careers can be pursued.</li>
<li>Appreciate that scientific understanding evolves from the interaction of ideas involving people with different views and backgrounds.</li>
<li>Work collaboratively in planning and carrying out investigations and in generating and evaluating ideas.</li>
<li>Seek and apply evidence when evaluating alternative approaches to investigations, problems and issues.</li>
<li>Demonstrate sensitivity and responsibility in pursuing a balance between the needs of humans and a sustainable environment.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cross-Curricular Connections</h3>
Social studies 10-1: Perspectives on Globalization: S.3, 3.8, 4.3; 10-2: Living in a Globalized World: S.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.8, 4.3; 20-1: Perspectives on Nationalism: S.3, 3.8; 20-2: Understandings of Nationalism: S.3, 3.8; 30-1: Perspectives on Ideologies: S.3, 1.6; 30-2: Understandings of Ideologies: S.3, 1.3, 1.6, 3.8. 

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>This activity requires four 80 minute class periods. After a teacher lead introduction to the activity during the first class the remainder of the class and the second and third class is devoted to student group work. Students are expected to spend time working on this project outside of class time. If the school has a no homework policy then allow for an additional class period to complete the project. During the research phase of the project the teacher is rotates among the groups ensuring that everyone stays on track.</p> 

<p>The poster sessions take place during the fourth class period. The teachers' role during the poster session is to rotate among the presentations evaluating the posters and the presentations using the provided rubric. The teacher may also have to direct students to what they are supposed to be doing, e.g. remind students of the role of the presenting groups (stay by their poster) and the non-presenting groups (rotate between posters) during a given session.</p>
