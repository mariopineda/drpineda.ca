You will have three classes for doing your research and preparing your poster. You are expected to provide data and sound scientific evidence to support your arguments. You have to provide complete citations to all your sources, e.g. to any claims you make, all figures and data sources. 

<h2>The Poster</h2>
Your poster has to be well organized, neat, typed (i.e. not hand written) and has to contain the following sections:
<ul>
<li>Title and name of authors</li>
<li>References and sources for visual components (images, graphs, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Presentations</h2>
During the last class there are three poster sessions, 25 minutes each. During your poster session you are expected to stand by your poster, present your poster to the audience and answer questions. When it is not your poster session you are expected to visit the other posters, listen to the presentations and ask questions of the presenters. 

<h2>Report</h2>
Following the poster presentations you will summarize what you have learned in a report ( each student will write their own report). In the report you have to address the role of climate change has for each of the research disciplines. The purpose of the report is to show the teacher your understanding of how climate change affects various aspects of our world. Feel free to include figures or drawings. 

The report is due in class the following day.

<h2>Plagiarism</h2>
Do not copy information from online sources, books etc. word by word. You may quote sources (in moderation) but you need to be clear on your poster that it is a quote (e.g. by putting it in quotation marks and providing a reference to the source).

<h2>Materials and Resources</h2>
<ul>
<li>Computer lab and/or laptop cart</li>
<li>Printer</li>
<li>Camera</li>
<li>Poster boards</li>
<li>Paper, markers, scissors, glue sticks</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<h3>Class 1</h3>
<ol>
<li>Choose your group partner</li>
<li>Choose the research discipline. Consult with your teacher if you have another research field you would like to use.</li>
<li>Get organized within your group, e.g. divide up work, assign task and roles.<li>
<li>Look through the <a href="/WebQuest/resources.html">resources section</a> and start your research.</li>
<li>Identify key questions that you will need to address in your field of research. Some examples of questions are;</li>
<ul>
<li>What effects does climate change in your area of research?</li>
<li>Explain (as detailed as possible) why the climate change has a specific effect?</li>
<li>What are the short term and long term consequences?</li>
<li>How can you illustrate the effects, i.e. graphs, maps, pictures, etc.</li> 
<li>Suggest ways to reduce our influences, and why they may work.</li> 
<li>Give examples/strategies of how scientists are working to mitigate the effects of global climate change in your research area.</li>
<li>Suggest improvements on these ideas.</li>
<l>Comment on their successes and failures and why they occurred.</li>
</ul> 
</ol>

<h3>Class 2</h3>
<ol>
<li>Continue your research using the guiding questions you identified in Class 1. Evaluate the questions, i.e. are they still relevant and/or are there other questions you can ask?<li>
<li>Start recording findings (in your own words) using a computer or hand written notes. Do not forget to keep track of your sources of information and images.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Class 3</h3>
<ol>
<li>Once you have all the necessary information and components for your poster (e.g. images, drawings, graphs, charts), create your poster.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Class 4</h3>
<ol>
<li>Each group is randomly assigned the time slot for their poster session.</li>
<li>Group presentations of posters.</li>
</ol>
