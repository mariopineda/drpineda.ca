<p>As part of this WebQuest you and your partner will collect and analyse data and research findings to investigate how antrophomorphic climate change affects key biotic and abiotic systems in your research area. You will have three classes for conducting your research and preparing your poster. Please note that you are expected to work on this assignent on your own time as well.</p>

<p>You poster has to include data (e.g. plots, graphs, figures, tables, etc.) and sound scientific evidence to support your arguments with complete citations to all your sources, e.g. to any claims you make, all figures and data sources.</p>

<h2>The Poster</h2>
<p>Your poster has to be well organized, neat, typed (i.e. not hand written). When printing your materials to put on the poster board, consider the font, font size, the amount of text on the board, and the size of the paper you are planning to put on the board. The poster should be easy to read from 1 meter away and has to include the following elements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Title and name of authors</li>
  <li>Demonstrate knowledge by identifying and explaining the key aspects of how climate change affects and will affect biotic and/or abiotic systems in your chosen research area.</li>
  <li>Use and explain the correct terminology using a scientific and professional language</li>
  <li>Each element on the poster has to have a clear function illustrating an aspect of your research findings using correct and neat labels</li>
  <li>Detailed conclusions clearly based on data and related to previous research findings
  <li>References and sources for visual components (images, graphs, etc.)</li>
  <li>Correct spelling and be grammatically correct.</li>
  <li>If you include pictures, graphs, or charts on you poster, always add a short caption <em>below</em> the element If you include a table on you poster include the caption <em>above</em> the table.</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-fair-projects/project_display_board.shtml#samples">Here are some examples of good posters</a>.

<h2>Presentations</h2>
<p>During the last class there will be three 25 minutes poster sessions. Your teacher will assign you and your partner to one of the poster sessions. During your assigned poster session you are expected to stand by your poster, present your poster to the audience and answer questions. When it is not your assigned poster session you are to visit the other posters, listen to the presentations and ask questions of the presenters.</p>

<h2>Report</h2>
<p>Following the poster presentations you will summarize what you have learned in a an individual report. Note that each student has to write their own report (in their own words). In the report you have to address the how climate change affects biotic and abiotic systems in each of the research disciplines. The purpose of the report is to show you teacher your understanding of the biotic and abiotic effects of climate change. Include figures or drawings is encouraged. </p>

<p>The report has to be typewritten and submitted electronically (shared through Google Docs). The report is due in class the following day.</p>

<h2>Plagiarism</h2>
<p>Do not copy information from online sources, books etc. word by word. You may use quotes (in moderation) but it has to clear on your poster that it is a quote (e.g. by putting it in quotation marks and providing a reference to the source).</p>

<p>Your report is an <em>individual</em> report, hence, you are not supposed to write it with your partner (this includes copying text from your partner, or anyone else for that matter).</p>

<h2>Materials and Resources</h2>
<ul>
<li>Computer lab and/or laptop cart</li>
<li>Printer</li>
<li>Camera</li>
<li>Poster boards</li>
<li>Paper, markers, scissors, glue sticks</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<h3>Class 1</h3>
<ol>
<li>Choose your group partner</li>
<li>Choose the research discipline. Consult with your teacher if you have another research field you would like to use.</li>
<li>Get organized within your group, e.g. divide up work, assign task and roles.</li>
<li>Look through the <a href="/WebQuest/resources.html">resources section</a> and start your research.</li>
<li>Identify key questions that you will need to address in your field of research. Some examples of questions are;</li>
<ul>
<li>What effects does climate change have in your area of research?</li>
<li>Explain (as detailed as possible) why the climate change has a biotic and/or abiotic specific effect?</li>
<li>How is Canada and Alberta "contributing" to these effects?</li>
<li>What are the short term and long term consequences?</li>
<li>What are the global effects? How is Canada and Alberta affected?
<li>How can you illustrate the effects, i.e. graphs, maps, pictures, etc.</li> 
<li>Suggest ways to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change. Explain why they may work.</li> 
<li>Give examples/strategies of how scientists are working to mitigate the effects of global climate change in your research area.</li>
<li>Suggest improvements on these ideas.</li>
<li>Comment on their successes and failures and why they occurred.</li>
</ul> 
</ol>

<h3>Class 2</h3>
<ol>
<li>Continue your research using the guiding questions you identified in Class 1. Evaluate the questions, i.e. are they still relevant and/or are there other questions you can ask?</li>
<li>Start recording findings (in your own words) using a computer or hand written notes. Do not forget to keep track of your sources of information and images.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Class 3</h3>
<ol>
<li>Once you have all the necessary information and components for your poster (e.g. images, drawings, graphs, charts), create your poster.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Class 4</h3>
<ol>
<li>Each group is randomly assigned the time slot for their poster session.</li>
<li>Group presentations of posters.</li>
</ol>
