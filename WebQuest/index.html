The Kyoto accord was a historical milestone as it was the first and only binding international  agreement that sets targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions


Start by looking at STS and find debatable and/or controversial issues
- Needs to address a debatable/controversial issue
- WebQuest needs to focus on the science and try to leave the emotions and feelings behind. Helping students understand science.
- Scaffolding their learning
- *Has* to stress social issues
- Provide a curriculum link (if it makes sense, some topics may only linked to loosly to PoS)
- How many lessons: 1-2 lessons (in highschool). Can be assigned as HW. 

- I provide the resources
- Role play?

At the end: Check your understanding (student's get to answer questions on a worksheet by talking to other "scientists" at the conference. AFterwards they hand in their worksheets with their answers. (Check Gizmos at learnalberta for ideas for teacher and studnet material)

For each topic: list key concepts that need to be covered

Travels with Darwin: Following in the footsteps of Charles Darwin

Needs to be unique, creative and well though out

- Process: Define a schedule, milestones and timelines for the students (make a unit plan and figure out how many lessons I have avaliable for the WebQuest)

- Resources: A combination of reading online, books, YouTube videos etc. Futuyama, Why evolution is true?
- Evaluation
- Conclusion
- References/credits
- Teacher's page: check on progrss with groups and make sure they are in line with milestones and timelines.

Tie in with authentic and important contemporary STS issues: natural selection and genetic engineering, artificial selection in livestock and/or pets, evolution of DEET resistance in mosquitos (http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100503/full/news.2010.216.html)

Townhall meeting / debate (e.g. a chairman, audience, etc), scientific meeting of the "Linnean society" where students read their peers papers and provide a peer review (through discussion or individually)
