<p>It is the fall of 2011 and Prime Minister Stephen Harper has announced that the Canadian Government will withdraw its support for the Kyoto Protocol. You are a scientist at a Canadian research institution doing research on climate change. You have been asked by the opposition to attend a senate hearing in the House of Commons to present evidence on climate change in a last-ditch attempt to reverse the governments decision. The scientific evidence you will present at the hearing will be pivotal in determining the future role Canada will play in stemming the tide of antrophomorphic climate change.</p>

<p>Working in pairs choose one of the scientific fields below. Your task is to pretend that you are researchers in the scientific discipline you have chosen. Your research and presentation should be focused on the research topic described under the discipline specifically addressing how climate change will affect the biotic and abiotic aspects of the ecological and/or environmental system you are researching. You will present your findings to the House of Commons (i.e. your class) and the Prime Minister (your teacher) during a poster session. You will have two classes to conduct your research, one class for organizing and creating the poster, and you will present your poster on the fourth day.</p>
