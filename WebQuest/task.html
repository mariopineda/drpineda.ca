<p class="lead">It is the fall of 2011 and Prime Minister Stephen Harper has announced that the Canadian Government will withdraw its support for the Kyoto Protocol. You are a scientist at a large well-renowned research institution doing research on climate change. You have been asked by the opposition to attend a senate hearing in the House of Commons to present evidence on climate change.</p>

<p class="lead">Working in pairs choose one of the disciplines below for your group. You may discuss with your teacher if you have another idea of interest to investigate on. Your task is to pretend that you are researchers in the discipline you have chosen. Your research and presentation should be focused on the research topic described under the discipline and specifically address how climate change will affect the biotic and abiotic aspects of the ecological and/or environmental system you are researching. You will present your findings to the House of Commons (i.e. your class) using a poster. You will have two classes to conduct your research, one class for organizing and creating the presentation, and finally a 10-minute presentation the following day(s).</p>
