<div class="well"><em>We, the human species, are confronting a planetary emergency â€“ a threat to the survival of our civilization that is gathering ominous and destructive potential even as we gather here.</em> - Al Gore, 2007 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speach</div>

<p>The Kyoto Protocol is an international treaty setting out binding obligations on the participating industrialized nations to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. The protocol was adopted in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, and was historical as it was the first, and to date only, binding environmental agreement with the goal of fighting antrophogenic (human-cause) climate change. While Canada was one of the 191 nation that ratified the treaty, in December 2011 Canada formally renounced the protocol and withdrew its commitments of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. As of today Canada remains the only nation that has withdrawn from the Kyoto Protocol.</p>

<p>
In this WebQuest you will learn about the significance of Canada's stance on antropogenic climate change by researching the many ways in which climate change is threatening our world. </p>
