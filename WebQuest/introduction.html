<div class="well"><em>We, the human species, are confronting a planetary emergency â€“ a threat to the survival of our civilization that is gathering ominous and destructive potential even as we gather here.</em> -- Al Gore, 2007 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speach</div>

<p>The Kyoto Protocol is an international treaty setting out binding obligations on the participating industrialized nations to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. The protocol was adopted in 1997 in Kyoto, Japan, and was historical as it was the first, and to date only, legally binding environmental agreement with the goal of fighting antrophogenic (human-cause) climate change. While Canada was one of the 191 nation that ratified the treaty, in December 2011 Canada took the unprecedented step of formally renounced the agreement thereby withdrawing its commitments of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. As of today Canada remains the only nation that has abandoned from the Kyoto Protocol.</p>

<p>Today Canada is among the top ten nations in terms of both its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_greenhouse_gas_emissions">total</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_greenhouse_gas_emissions_per_capita">per capita</a> green house gas emissions. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_sands#Greenhouse_gas_emissions">largest and fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions in Canada is the Alberta oilsands industry</a>.
If Alberta would be a country its per capita greenhouse gas emissions would be higher than any other nation in the world.</p>   

<p>In this WebQuest you will investigate and learn about the significance of Canada's stance on antropogenic climate change and its growing global carbon footprint by researching the many ways in which climate change is threatening our world. </p>
