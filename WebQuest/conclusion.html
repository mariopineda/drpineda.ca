<p>In this WebQuest you have, together with your peers, researched the many aspects of how antrophomorphic climate change affects our world. Think about what you have learned? How has your research changed how you view climate change and the role Canada plays in it?</p> 

<p>With the knowledge you have gained, consider the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What consequences of climate change do you find most concerning on a global scale?</li> 
  <li>What consequences of climate change do you find most concerning for Canada?</li>
  <li>If it would be possible to travel back in time to late 2011, right before Canada withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, what arguments and evidence would use to try to prevent Canada from withdrawing?</li>
</ul>

<p>In the end we are in this planetary emergency together and it is only if we work together, as nations and as human beings, that we may hope to stem the tide of climate change, or in Mathatma Gandhi's word:
<blockquote><em>We need to be the change we wish to see in the world.</em></blockquote>
