Travels with Darwin: Following in the footsteps of Charles Darwin

Needs to be unique, creative and well though out

Unit C: The Changing Earth; General Outcome 3: Students will analyze and assess the evidence provided by the fossil record of change in the environment and life forms over a period of 3.5 billion years. (p. 38, PoS Biology 20-30, Alberta Education)

Vertical navigation bar to these subpages:
- Introduction: Written intro + a video with animations made by me (Darwin sock puppet al la Chilean skit)
- Task: Collect evidence supporting evolution and make a presentation to you class
- Process: Define a schedule, milestones and timelines for the students (make a unit plan and figure out how many lessons I have avaliable for the WebQuest)

What is defined by the problem? Mosquitos are becoming resistant to DEET. Mosquitos bit humans and animals. Mosiqutous are a nuisance and can transmit diseases.
What do we already know?
What needs to be known? How and why are mosquitos becoming resistant to DEET?

- Resources: A combination of reading online, books, YouTube videos etc. Futuyama, Why evolution is true?
- Evaluation
- Conclusion
- References/credits
- Teacher's page: check on progrss with groups and make sure they are in line with milestones and timelines.

Tie in with authentic and important contemporary STS issues: natural selection and genetic engineering, artificial selection in livestock and/or pets, evolution of DEET resistance in mosquitos (http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100503/full/news.2010.216.html)

Townhall meeting / debate (e.g. a chairman, audience, etc), scientific meeting of the "Linnean society" where students read their peers papers and provide a peer review (through discussion or individually)

Questions for students to address:
- Identify evidence for evolution (describe and provide 5 pieces of evidence for the theory of evolution) from different scientist, e.g. Darwin, Wallace, Lyell, 
- Is it important to understand evolution? Why?
- How is the theory of platectonics useful in the study of evolution?
