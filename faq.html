Sometimes I get asked questions. Here are the most common ones in no particular order.

<h3>Why are you becoming a teacher?</h3>
After almost two decades as a researcher in academia, government and industry I reached a point in my career where I realized that as much as I love doing science my true passion is in teaching and sharing my excitement and love for science, engineering and mathematics with children and youth. Once I realized where my true passion was, the decision to take my career to the next level was a straight forward decision. 

<h3>Why did you leave academia?</h3>
Academia is an unique place for pushing the boundaries of what we know, what we can do and to pursue your curiosity in whatever direction it takes you. I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to be a researcher in academia for almost two decades. I retired from academic research in 2012 to take my carer to the next level by pursuing a teaching degree.

<h3>Can you send me a reprint of one of your papers?</h3>
Assuming I have a PDF version of the paper I would be happy to. Make your request at my <a href="{{ site.url }}/contact/">contact page</a>. For a somewhat complete list of my publications see my <a href="http://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=l8NIuq4AAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar page</a>.

<h3>Can you review a paper/book chapter/grant, etc?</h3>
Due to other commitments I am no longer able to review any academic material.

<h3>Can you tutor me or my child?</h3>
Unfortunately I am no longer able to accept new students.

<h3>Can you give a classroom presentation in my class?</h3>
I would be happy to. I currently give classroom presentations in the Edmonton area on the grade 6 Trees & Forests Unit. To request a presentation please use the <a href="http://www.sciencehotline.ca/index.php/teachers/classroom-presentations-scientist-and-engineer-in-the-classroom">ESON booking procedures</a>.

<h3>Can I join the FIRST robotics team?</h3>
I am coaching several FIRST robotics team for different age groups (JrFLL 6-9, FLL 10-14 and FRC 15-18). If you live in Edmonton and are interested in joining one of the robotics teams have one of your parents <a href="{{ site.url }}/contact/">contact me</a>. 

<h3>Can you help me with <em>[insert problematic R feature]</em> R feature and/or there is a bug in your R package?</h3>
