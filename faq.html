Sometimes I get asked questions. Here are some of the more common ones in no particular order.

<h3>Why are you becoming a teacher?</h3>
After almost two decades as a researcher in academia, government and industry I reached a point in my career where I realized that as much as I love doing science my true passion is in teaching and sharing my excitement and love for science, engineering and mathematics with children and youth. Once I realized where my true passion was the decision to take my career to the next level was a straightforward decision. 

<h3>Why did you leave academia?</h3>
Academia is an unique place for pushing the boundaries of what we know, what we can do and to pursue your curiosity in whatever direction it takes you. I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to be a researcher in academia for almost two decades. I retired from academic research in 2012 in order to take my career to the next level by pursuing a teaching degree. See question above as to why I decided to become a teacher? 

<h3>Can you give a classroom presentation in my class?</h3>
