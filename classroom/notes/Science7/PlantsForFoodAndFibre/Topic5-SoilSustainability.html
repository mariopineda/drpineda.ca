# Soil
- Soil, aka the dirt, is the medium in which plants grow.
- There are different soils in the world, depending on many factors 
- Soil is made of many different substances including:
  - Parent materials: non-organic materials like sediments, minerals, clay. Non-organic: materials that do not contain carbon 
  - Water
  - Organic things like decaying plant parts (leaves, flowers, fruit, bark, etc.). Organic: materials that contain carbon.  Usually indicate that it is from a biotic factor (living thing). All living things have lots of carbon it them.

# Other factors that affect soil production
- The type and amount of vegetation in the area
- The amount of moisture in the soil
- Minerals like vermiculite (a silicon material that helps retain water and create air pockets – looks like styrofoam) or perlite (comes from volcanic glass and helps hold water and loosen soil so plants can grow).
- Amount of oxygen, nitrogen, and other gases
- The types and amount of biotic organisms in the soil (worms, insects, fungi, bacteria)

Together, these factors will help break down both organic and non-organic matter down in to smaller pieces to enrich the soil. This nutrient-rich soil is called humus and is in the top layer of the soil.  It is often called the topsoil. The humus helps retain water and nutrients and further enriches the soil.

# Soil profile
A soil profile is the cross-section of entire layers of soil that indicate what it is made of, like layers in a cake. These layers are called horizons or strata.

# Biotic factors in the soil
- Bacteria: the most diverse and numerous. Bacteria decompose organic matter into nutrients for plants and other organisms. One of the most important soil bacteria is actinomycetes.
- Fungi: include mushrooms, moulds, and yeast. They also decompose organic matter. Often found on rotting logs.
- Earthworms: often called the “digestion system of the Earth” because they digest organic matter and their feces are rich in nutrients. Their worm holes also help mix gases in to the soil (this is called aeration)as well as provide ways for water to flow around in the soil
