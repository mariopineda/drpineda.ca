# This is the second slide
- Liquid and gaseous fluids in a closed system exert pressure.
- Pressure: a measure of the force with which a fluid pushes on the walls of the container that contains it.
- Pressure is calculated by dividing the force by the area upon which the force is exerted.

$$P = \frac{\mbox{Force}}{\{\mbox{Area}}} = \frac{F}{A}$$

# Math Display and Inline

1. This is an inline integral: `\(\int_a^bf(x)dx\)`
2. More `\(x={a \over b}\)` formulae.

Display formula:
    $$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$$
	`\(-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over {2a}\)`
