# Gases and liquids under pressure

Gases and liquids can be placed under very high pressure, as long as the container is strong enough to contain it. 

Any kind of opening causes the fluid to shoot out of the container with great force.

# Aerosol
- Aerosols are canisters with a fluid under pressure.
- Used to contain CFC’s (chlorofluorocarbon), a gas that helps keep it under pressure. 
- CFC's destroy the Earth's ozone, the gas layer that absorbs much harmful UV rays.  
- CFC’s no longer in aerosol or styrofoam.

# Examples of fluids under pressure
- Shaving gel, air freshner
- Gasoline pump
- Pop bottle/cans
- Water pumps/hose
- Bloodstream
- Oxygen tank
- Hydraulic systems

# Hydraulic systems
- Liquids are incompressible.
- Hydraulics: A mechanism that forces a liquid under pressure in an enclosed container to move something.

# Hydraulic fluids
- The original hydraulic fluid, dating back to the time of ancient Egypt, was water.
- These days mineral oil is used as a fluid in hydraulic systems because it is viscous and coats parts effectivelly, it acts as a lubricant, and does not freeze.
- When biodegradability is important canola oil is used as a hydraulic fluid.

# Examples of hydraulic systems
- Dentist chair
- Forklift
- Car lift in an auto bodyshop 
- Elevators
- Escalators
- Construction vehicles
- Water and oil pipelines

# Pipelines
Water and oil can be transported over long distances using pumps and forcing immense pressure on the liquids.
The liquid is pushed along the reinforced pipes.

Pumping stations help replace the pressure lost by friction of particles on the pipes.

# Pneumatic systems
- Similar to hydraulics, except a gas is used.
- Recall that gases can be rapidly compressed and decompressed.
- The force of the gas being decompressed is used to move objects.
- Uses:  dentist tools, air brakes, tampers, jackhammers, heavy machinery

# Think about it! More on pressure...
Jennifer notices that she sinks in the snow when walking in her snow boots, but she stays near the surface of the snow when walking in her snowshoes. The force exerted on the snow by Jeniffer's mass is 600 N. The surface area of her sole of one of her snow boots is 1000 `\( \mbox{cm}^2 \)`, and the surface area of one of her snowshoes is 2800 `\( \mbox{cm}^2 \)`. Compare the pressure Jennifer exerts on the snow with her snow boots and with her snowshoes. Use the calculation results to expplain the reason her snowshoes prevent her from sinking in the snow.

---
# Solution
Pressure exerted in snow boots:

$$P=\frac{F}{A} = \frac{\mbox{Force exerted by Jennifer's mass}}{\mbox{Surface area of snow boot}}$$

$$P=\frac{600~\mbox{N}}{1000~\mbox{cm}^2} = 0.600~\mbox{N}/\mbox{cm}^2$$

Pressure exerted in snowshoes:

$$P=\frac{F}{A} = \frac{\mbox{Force exerted by Jennifer's mass}}{\mbox{Surface area of snowshoes}}$$

$$P=\frac{600~\mbox{N}}{2800~\mbox{cm}^2} = 0.214~\mbox{N}/\mbox{cm}^2$$

---
# Solution (cont.)
Comparing the pressures:

$$\frac{\mbox{Pressure exerted in snow boots}}{\mbox{Pressure exerted in snowshoes}} = \frac{0.600}{0.214} = 2.8$$

The pressure Jennifer exerts on the snow in snow boots is `\( 2.8 \times \)` greater than the pressure she exerts in snowshoes. By reducing the pressure she exererts, the greater surface area of snowshoes prevents Jennifer from sinking into the snow.

# Lab: Compression of Liquids and Gases
- p81 in textbook
- Groups of 3
- Division of labour:
  - syringe operator (With a water-filled syringe, comes great responsibility)
  - ruler operator (have to be quick and accurate)
  - data recorder (has to be organized and meticulous)
- Different groups will use different sized syringes
- Follow instructions in textbook (omit step 7) 

## Procedure
1. Read the insteructions
1. Before the experiment: Start by making predictions (see textbook)
1. Do the experiment 
1. Answer questions: 1-4 and 6
1. Explain your results using the particle model
