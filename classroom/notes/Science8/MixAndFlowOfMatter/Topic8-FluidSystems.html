# Gases and liquids under pressure

Gases and liquids can be placed under very high pressure, as long as the container is strong enough to contain it. 

Any kind of opening causes the fluid to shoot out of the container with great force.  

---
# Aerosol
- Aerosols are canisters with a fluid under pressure.
- Used to contain CFC’s, a gas that helps keep it under pressure. But it also causes destruction of ozone, the gas layer that absorbs much harmful UV rays.  
- CFC’s no longer in aerosol or styrofoam

# Examples of fluids under pressure
- Shaving gel, air freshner
- Gasoline pump
- Pop bottle/cans
- Water pumps/hose
- Bloodstream
- Pistons in car engines
- Oxygen tank
- Hydraulic systems

# Hydraulic systems
Recall that liquids are incompressible.

A mechanism that forces a liquid under pressure in an enclosed container to move something.

An applied force creates pressure to “push” other systems or objects.

# Oil in hydralic systems
Oil is used as a fluid in hydralic systems because it is viscous and coats parts effectivelly, it acts as a lubricant, and does not freeze.

---
# Examples of hydraulics
- Dentist chair
- Forklift
- Car lift in an auto bodyshop 
- Elevators
- Escalators
- Construction vehicles
- Water and oil pipelines

# Pipelines
Water and oil can be transported over long distances using pumps and forcing immense pressure on the liquids.
The liquid is pushed along the reinforced pipes.

Pumping stations help replace the pressure lost by friction of particles on the pipes.

---
# Pneumatic systems
- Similar to hydraulics, except a gas is used.
- Recall that gases can be rapidly compressed and decompressed.
- The force of the gas being decompressed is used to move objects.
- Uses:  dentist tools, air brakes, tampers, jackhammers, heavy machinery
