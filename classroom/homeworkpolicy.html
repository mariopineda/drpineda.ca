<h3>HW policy</h3>
<p>Homework prepares students for topics that will be covered in class, reinforces concepts already covered in class, engages students with topics outside of class, allows parents to become part of their child's learning, and is mandated by the school. Students and parents should expect daily homework in both science and math. When no specific homework has been assigned students are expected to review notes and material covered in the preceding class as this will be the topic of the next bell work. Students not finishing work assigned during class are required to complete the work on their own time.</p>

<p>Sometimes homework spans several days, e.g. over weekends, for larger homework and for projects (e.g. the science fair). For multiday homework students are expected to use their time wisely by dividing up the work over several days as necessary to avoid last minute time crunches where all the work is done the night before it is due. </p>

<p>It is the parents responsibility to sign the students homework agenda and check the homework (but not do the homework for the students). Occasionally homework has to be done on a computer and printed out. It is the parents' responsibility to ensure  that the students has access to a working computer and printer (including ensuring an adequate supply of printer toner is available). It is not the teachers responsibility to print student work. Homework not handed in due to last minute unexpected computer or printer problems (including running out of toner) has to be accompanied by a written and signed note from the patent and an electronic copy on a USB memory stick to show that the work has been completed. Students not having access to a computer, internet or a printer at home are required to bring this to the attention to Dr. Pineda early, i.e. well <strong>before</strong> the homework is due.</p>
