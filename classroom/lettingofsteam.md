<h1>Letting of STEAM</h1>
<p><em>Topics in Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics</em></p>

<p>All students will be making a number of presentations on 21st century events and/or newstories in STEAM throughout the school year. After being assigned a presentation date by your teacher write it down in your agenda and plan ahead for its arrival. It is your responsibility to be prepared to present when your date arrives. If you have a problem with the date you have been assigned, it is *your responsibility* to find a classmate to switch with and to notify your teacher of the switch so the class calendar can be updated. The list of presentation dates is avaliable here.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Finding a topic</h2>
<p>Find a news item related to STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art or Mathematics) that was published and/or occured during the 21st century. Your news item has to relate to science and/or mathematics and has to be supported by one or several reputable online sources. See links below for examples of appropriate online sources.</p>
	
<p>Examples of approporiate (i.e. reputable) online sources:</p>
* [ScienceNews](https://www.sciencenews.org/)
* [ScienceDaily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/)
* [BBC Science & Environment](http://www.bbc.com/news/science_and_environment/)
* [Science/AAAS News](http://news.sciencemag.org/)
* [Sci-News](http://www.sci-news.com/)
* [Nature News & Comment](http://www.nature.com/news/)
* [CBC Technology & Science](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology)
* [PHYS.ORG](http://phys.org/)
* [University of Alberta - Faculty of Science](http://uofa.ualberta.ca/science)
* [Beaty Biodiverdity Museum](http://www.beatymuseum.ubc.ca/blog)
* [Science 2.0](http://www.science20.com/)
* [NY Times Science](http://www.nytimes.com/pages/science/index.html)

<h2>Step 2: Written response</h2>
<p>Your written response to your story has to include the following:</p>
* A summary in 50-75 words based on the WHO, WHAT, WHERE, AND WHEN, WHY, and HOW of the story.
* A personal response in 50 - 75 words. Use this opportunity to express your personal opinions about your choosen story. Take a stance and support or disagree providing a rationale for your stance (i.e. "I agree/disagree with ... because ...").</p>
* Develop 5-7 questions to be used during your presentation to spark discussion. These questions should not be factual, quizzing your classmates as to what happened in the story. They should inspire your classmates to analyze your story, create their own opinion about it and allow them to critically evaluate the facts.</p>
* The links (URLs) of your online sources.

<p>Your summary and personal response has to include clear topic sentences.</p>
	
<p>Your written response has to be submitted *before your presentation date* using the online form here.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Presentation</h2>
<p>In your presentation you will summarize and critically evaluate your news item in your own words. Include only facts in your summary that you can support using one or several online sources. Discuss the WHO, WHAT, WHERE, AND WHEN, WHY, and HOW of the story.</p>

<p>Your presentation should be 10 minutes long in total and broken down as follows:</p>
* 2 minutes to summarize the story
* 7 minutes class discussion
* 1 minute wrap-up your presentation & express your own opinions or thoughts on the matter

<h2>Not prepared on presentation day</h2>
<p>What happens if you are not prepared to present on your presentation day or if your written portion is not submitted before the presentation date?</p>
* You will receive a zero for the assignment.
* You will not have an opportunity to present your work to your class.
* Your parents will be notified.
* You are still responsible to complete the written work during recess and lunch detention. 

<h2>How to ask great questions</h2>
...

<h2>Tips for acing your assignment</h2>
* Start your online search early (at least one week before your presentation date, preferable even earlier)
* Find more than one reputable online source 
* If you are not sure if a source is "reputable"; ask your teacher (you may have to show your teacher the web site).
* Make your story relevant. Why should we care? Why is this important? Connect your story to yourself and/or to Edmonton/Alberta/Canada.
* Use visuals (map, picture, graph, diagram, props, etc.). Videos and PowerPoint-style presentations are discouraged. If you have to use a video and/or a PowerPoint-styled slides it will have to be preapproved by your teacher at least 1 week before your presentation date.
* Practice your presentation along and with an audience (parents, siblings, friends, etc.).
