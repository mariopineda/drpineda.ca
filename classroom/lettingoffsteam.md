<h1><em>Letting off STEAM</em> Assignment</h1>
<p><em>Current Events in Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics</em></p>

<p>All students will be making a number of presentations on current events in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics) throughout the school year. After being assigned a presentation date by your teacher write it down in your agenda and plan ahead for its arrival. It is your responsibility to be prepared to present when your date arrives. If you have a problem with the date you have been assigned, it is <strong>your responsibility</strong> to find a classmate to switch with and to notify your teacher of the switch so the class calendar can be updated. The list of presentation dates is avaliable <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y_b_imhDCj5xEqRoVe2hgBfz0_gmdVjF0P1YJiA2gMk/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. You will be marked using <a href="lettingoffsteamrubric.pdf">the following rubric</a>.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Finding a topic</h2>
<p>Find a current topic related to STEAM. The topic must be clearly connected to one or several of the disciplies that are part of STEAM, e.g. a STEAM-focused news story, popular science article or blog post, a scientific and/or mathematical discovery, STEAM project, notable award (hint, Nobel Prize, Fields Medal, Crafoord Prize, Killiam Program, MacArthur Fellows Program, Millennium Prize Problems Awards, etc.), invention or breakthrough that is less than 6 months old. The topic has to be supported by one or several reputable online sources. See links below for examples of appropriate online sources.</p>
	
<p>Examples of appropriate (i.e. reputable) online sources:</p>
* [ScienceNews](https://www.sciencenews.org/)
* [ScienceDaily](http://www.sciencedaily.com/)
* [BBC Science & Environment](http://www.bbc.com/news/science_and_environment/)
* [Science/AAAS News](http://news.sciencemag.org/)
* [Sci-News](http://www.sci-news.com/)
* [Nature News & Comment](http://www.nature.com/news/)
* [CBC Technology & Science](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology)
* [PHYS.ORG](http://phys.org/)
* [University of Alberta - Faculty of Science](http://uofa.ualberta.ca/science)
* [Beaty Biodiverdity Museum](http://www.beatymuseum.ubc.ca/blog)
* [Science 2.0](http://www.science20.com/)
* [NY Times Science](http://www.nytimes.com/pages/science/index.html)
* [Art & Science Journal](http://www.artandsciencejournal.com/#top)
* [Exploratorium](http://www.exploratorium.edu/explore)
* [Flowing Data](http://flowingdata.com/)
* [Phenomena - A science salon hosted by National Geographic Magazine](http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/)
* [Field of Science](http://www.fieldofscience.com/)

<p>While your topic can be based on scientific controversies, the opposing sides in the controversy have to be bona fide scientist (not quacks, which rules out most politicians, celebrities and journalists when it comes to providing accurate and unbiased science perspectives). "Fluff" topics are not acceptable. This includes (but is not limited to) the majority of viral stories/posts on social media, topics that do not have a clear and unambiguous scientific rationale (e.g. pseudoscientific and super-natural phenomena) and stories from tabloid web sites/magazines. If you are not sure of the veracity of a piece that you would like to use, get feedback from your teacher.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Written response</h2>
<p>Your written response has to include the following:</p>
* A summary in 50-75 words based on the WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, WHY and HOW of the story.
* A personal response in 50-75 words. Use this opportunity to express your personal opinions. Take a stance and support or disagree providing a rationale for your stance (i.e. "I agree/disagree with ... because ...").

<p>If you are in grade 8 your written response also has to include the following:</p>
* Develop 5-7 questions to be used during your presentation to spark discussion. These questions should not be factual, quizzing your classmates. They should inspire your classmates to analyze the topic, create their own opinion about it and allow them to critically evaluate the facts.
* The references to your online sources. You must use APA style.

<p>Your summary and personal response has to include clear topic sentences and be written using proper grammatics, spelling and punctuation.</p>
	
<p>Your written response has to be submitted <strong>before your presentation date</strong>. Grade 8s submit the written response using the <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/JLpXzRqB6c">following form</a> and grade 7 will use <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/pL1GGxj5MC">this form</a>.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Presentation</h2>
<p>During your presentation you will summarize and critically evaluate the topic using your own words. Include only facts in your summary that you can support using one or several online sources. Discuss the WHO, WHAT, WHERE, AND WHEN, WHY and HOW of the story.</p>

<p>Your presentation should be 10 minutes long in total and broken down as follows:</p>
* 2 minutes to summarize the story
* 7 minutes class discussion
* 1 minute wrap-up your presentation & express your own opinions and thoughts.

<h2>Not prepared on presentation day?</h2>
<p>What happens if you are not prepared to present on your presentation day or if your written portion is not submitted before the presentation date?</p>
* You will receive a zero for the assignment.
* You will not have an opportunity to present your work to your class.
* Your parents will be notified.
* You are still responsible to complete the written work during recess and lunch detention. 

<p>If you are absent from school on your presentation day you will present when you are back at school.</p>

<h2>Tips for acing your assignment</h2>
* Familiarize yourself with the <a href="lettingoffsteamrubric.pdf">rubric</a>.
* Start your online search early (at least one week before your presentation date, preferable even earlier). 
* Do not forget your presentation date!
* Put in a solid effort and do not try to wing it last minute.
* Find more than one reputable online source.
* If you are not sure if a source is "reputable"; ask your teacher (you may have to show your teacher the web site).
* Make your story relevant. Why should we care? Why is this important? Connect your story to yourself and/or to Edmonton/Alberta/Canada.
* Use visuals (map, picture, graph, diagram, white board, props, etc.). Videos and PowerPoint-style presentations are discouraged. If you have to use a video and/or PowerPoint-styled slides it will have to be preapproved by your teacher at least 1 week before your presentation date.
* Practice your presentation alone and with an audience (parents, siblings, friends, etc.).
* Start each paragraph with a good topic sentences and use proper spelling, puctuation and grammar.
* Make eye contact with and engage your audience during the presentation.

<h2>Why the 'A' in STEAM?</h2>
<p>Someone once said "Without mathematics there is no art". There are many examples of science and mathematics expressed through art as well as art inspiring mathematics, engineering and science. Visual art has also historically played an important role in documenting and celebrating scientific and technological achievements. Here are just a few examples:</p>
* <a href="http://www.telusplanet.net/public/gdevries/">The mathematics of quilts</a>.
* <a href="http://www.goldennumber.net/art-composition-design/">The Golden Ratio in Art and Design</a>.
* The <a href="http://www.youraga.ca/about-us/the-building/">architectural design of the Art Gallery of Alberta</a> located in downtown Edmonton takes its insipration from the meandering North Saskatchewan River and the Northern Lights.
* <a href="http://islamic-arts.org/2011/medieval-islamic-mosaics-and-modern-maths/">Mathematical patterns in mosques</a>.
* <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/historicalanatomies/browse.html">Historical anatomical illustrations</a> by, e.g. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17907305">Leonardo da Vinci</a>.
