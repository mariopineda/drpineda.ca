# Practices in software development

* Commit early and often
* Push you local commits to GitHub early and often
* Keep different projects in separate repositories - specifically, your class project has to have its own repository
* Make useful commit messages. Your commit messages have to be insightful, descriptive and specific without actually giving the exact details of the commit (which can easily be obtained by a diff anyway).
* Use the first line of the commit message to provide a short (50-72 character) summary of the commit change. Trying git log --oneline might help you understand why. See [www.tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a] for even more details on git commit messages.
* Do not change commit history.
* Do not include binary files in your commits if they can easily be regenerated (e.g. by compiling code)  
* Do not use closed source proprietary formats for code, notes, slides, etc. In other words, do not use Word files, Power Point files, etc. unless pre-approved by your teacher (and your teacher will only approve this if the use of these formats is integral to your project).
