<h3>Plagiarism policy</h3>
<p>Plagiarism is a serious academic offence and is an unacceptable practice in professional life and at all levels of studies. The following are the consequences for a student caught the first time plagiarizing work for a hand-in assignment:
<ol>
	<li>A zero mark on the assignment and 24hrs to resubmitt a new assignment.</li>
	<li>A note or phone call to parents.</li>
	<li>The new assignment will be marked out of a 50% of the original maximum score, e.g. if the plagirized assignment was out of 10 points the mark on the resubmitted assignment will be out 5 points.
</ol>
Note that these consequences are only for first time offenders.
