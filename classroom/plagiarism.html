<h1>Plagiarism</h1>

<blockquote>
<em>Plagiarism is the "wrongful appropriation" and "stealing and publication" of another author's "language, thoughts, ideas, or expressions" and the representation of them as one's own original work.</em> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism">Wikipedia, 2014</a>)
</blockquote> 


<p>Plagiarism is a serious academic offence and is an unacceptable practice in professional life and at all levels of studies. The following are the consequences for a student caught the first time plagiarizing work for a hand-in assignment:
<ol>
	<li>A zero mark on the original assignment.</li>
	<li>A note or phone call to parents.</li>
	<li>A rewritten assignment has to be resubmitted within 24 hours. The assignment has to be signed by a parent.</li>
	<li>The new assignment will be marked out of a 50% of the original maximum score, e.g. if the plagiarized assignment was out of 10 points the mark on the resubmitted assignment will be out 5 points.</li>
</ol>
Note that these consequences are only for first time offences. Students found plagiarizing a second time (or more) will automatically get a zero on the assignment and their parents will be called in for a meeting with the teacher.
