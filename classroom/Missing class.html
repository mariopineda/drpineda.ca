  If you miss a class it is important to catch up on missed work before you return to school. You will not have time to catch up during class, hence you need to catch up on your own time. Before you come back to school after an absence do the following (in this order):
1) check online on this web page for handouts, notes, and homework
2) call your homework buddy about what we went through in class. 
3) catch up on missed assignments and HW 
Once you are back at school come and talk to me.

<h3>Extended absences</h3>
Extended absences (1 week or more) during the school year are likely to have a significant detrimental impact on your learning. Unless you have an excused absence or extenuating circumstances (note that vacations are not considered excused absences nor extenuating circumstances) you will be required to complete all class work (homework, assignments, projects, test and exams etc.) by obtaining notes, handouts and homework in science and math from this website and by staying in touch with your homework partner throughout your absence. During extended absence students are strongly advised to keep up with their school work rather than saving it for after returning to school. Missed tests and exams will be written upon return. You will need to be prepared to write missed exams within a week after return to school. There is no make up for missed bell work. 

Because homework, notes and handouts are made available on this website as we go through in in class it will not be made available to individual students ahead of time. It is the students responsibility to obtaining missing materials (eg homework, handouts, class notes, eats.) from this website and/or from their homework partners.
