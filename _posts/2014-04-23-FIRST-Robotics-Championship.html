<p>Today the <a href="http://championship.usfirst.org/">2014 <em>FIRST</em> Robotics Championship</a> starts. This annual event represents the culmination of all the <em>FIRST</em> programs, i.e. JrFLL, FLL, FTC, and FRC, and is a celebration of science, technology, engineering, and math. <em>FIRST</em>, <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/">For the Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology</a>, is a remarkable non-profit organization that started over 25 years ago in high-school gym in New Hampshire. Today the <em>FIRST</em> organization touches the lives of over 350,000 young people in 80 countries. The program consists of four core programs, the Junior <em>FIRST LEGO</em> League aka JrFLL for ages 6-9, the <em>FIRST LEGO</em> League aka FLL for ages 10-14, the <em>FIRST</em> Tech Challenge aka FTC for grades 7-12 and the <em>FIRST</em> Robotics Competition aka FRC for ages 14-18. The goals of all the programs is to be an incubator for the development of future generations of innovators, tinkerers, doers, and thinkers by introducing kids to the fun, wonder, and endless possibilities of science, technology, engineering, and math.</p>

<p>Much of the action at the championship will be <a href="http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/robotics/">streamed live at NASA TV</a> including the opening ceremony. The full spectator schedule of the event can be found <a href="http://championship.usfirst.org/FIRST-championship/spectator-schedule">here</a>. The FLL opening ceremony starts today (April 23, 2014) at 6:30pm Central Time Zone (i.e. what they have in St. Louise where the championship is held) corresponding to 5:30pm Mountain Time Zone (i.e. Edmonton). The FRC opening ceremony starts one hour later at 7:30pm local time (6:30pm Mountain time). The event runs over the next three days until Saturday evening. All the live streams can be found <a href="http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/robotics/first/st-louis-2014/index-live.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>I will particularly be keeping a close eye on the FRC part of the event with participating teams from wide and far, including Brazil (1), Canada (37 of which 2 are from Alberta), Chile (1), China (1), Dominican Republic (1), Israel (6), Mexico (10), Netherlands (1), UK (1) and USA (too many to count). There are three FRC teams I am rooting for, the two teams from Alberta, i.e. <a href="https://my.usfirst.org/myarea/index.lasso?page=team_details&tpid=215549">Alberta Tech Alliance (4334)</a> and <a href="https://my.usfirst.org/myarea/index.lasso?page=team_details&tpid=216147">Sir Winston Churchill (4719)</a> and the one Chilean team <a href="https://my.usfirst.org/myarea/index.lasso?page=team_details&tpid=213385">Coraz√≥n de Chileno (2576)</a>. All the latest scores and results for the FRC games can be found at the <a href="http://www.thebluealliance.com/">Blue Alliance</a>.</p>
