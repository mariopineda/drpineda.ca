description: Classroom pets offer many learning opportunities in the science class room. A few days ago the first group of classroom animals arrived to their new home in my new classroom ready to start their important educational and outreach mission.

<p>What is a science classroom without classroom pets? While this may be a rhetorical question my experiences from my student teaching practicums clearly illustrated the countless ways classroom pets offer learning opportunities. Classroom pets allow students, some of which may not have access to pets outside of school, to interact, bond with and care for animals responsibly by establishing healthy child-pet relationships at an early age. Well-cared for classroom pets, i.e. inhabiting habitat that are set up to mimic their natural habitats, also provides an excellent opportunity to tie in the ecology, physiology and behaviour of the animals with material covered in class, e.g. life cycles, behaviour, ecology, etc., as well as connect with Nature of Science concepts such as the value of observational studies (i.e. recording observations, inference and drawing conclusions; think a classroom version of Jane Goodall) </p>

<p>Over the last few weeks I have been busy setting up habitats in my classroom for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard_gecko">leopard gecko</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_bellied_toad">fire-bellied toads</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_mystery_snail">mystery snails</a>. Last week the big day arrived as the first group of classroo animals moved into their new habitats, three mystery snails, two fire-bellied toads and one leopard gecko. The animals do not have any names yet - who is better to name them than their future care takers, the students. The same day I also found out that I had been approved for the <a href="http://www.petsintheclassroom.org/">Pets in the Classroom grant</a>..., so there is more to come.</p>
