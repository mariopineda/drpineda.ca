The last week's experience have made me start thinking about how teachers assign evaluate homework. While I am, at least in principle, 

The problem with homework

bell work, short exercises that students complete while the instructor attends to attendance and other administrative chores. 

On Friday my MT was away and a substitute teacher was attending the class together with me. It was an interesting experience as she let me do the teacher directed component of the lesson and then fully immersed herself in the student directed part, very clearly enjoying a somewhat different lesson.

Before the student's arrived for the first class of the day the substitute teacher asked me "What do you do when the students arrive?". Initially I was a bit taken back by the as I was not entirely sure what she was actually asking. Then we got interrupted as the students arrived. While I was setting up the lesson I noticed that she stood in the doprway, greeting the students and taking attendance as they were entering. As the class started my I forgot about this. It was not until the weekend, as I was reflecrting back on the past week, that started thinking about these events agiain.
