Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming">defines computer programming</a> as:
<blockquote>"...the process of designing, writing, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of computer programs. This source code is written in one or more programming languages. The purpose of programming is to create a set of instructions that computers use to perform specific operations or to exhibit desired behaviors. The process of writing source code often requires expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms and formal logic."</blockquote>
To most of us this probably sounds like an activity that only a highly educated professional would be able to master, right? Wrong! Meet Scratch, the programming language designed for children and youth to enable them to create their own computer programs while learning important mathematical and computational concepts and to think creatively, reason systematically and work collaboratively. Scratch is the brain child of <a class="zem_slink" title="MIT Media Lab" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=42.3608,-71.08768&amp;spn=1.0,1.0&amp;q=42.3608,-71.08768 (MIT%20Media%20Lab)&amp;t=h" target="_blank" rel="geolocation">MIT Media Lab</a> and was created to motivate for further learning through playfully experimenting and creating projects, such as interactive animations, games, music, and art - and share their creations on the web.

Recently the faculty of <em>The Rocket Scientists</em> assembled in their HQ with the aim of running a lazy Sunday Scratch hackathon. We set out with no real goal in sight, other than taking Scratch for a spin to see what a 7-year-old could do with it in an afternoon. Very soon it became apparent that young kids indeed can do programming using Scratch and create remarkably sophisticated programs in a very short amount of time with no adult help what so ever. Scratch is unique as far as programming languages go in that it has a tactile and visual GUI allowing children to explore by dragging-and-dropping blocks of conditions (with parameters) and of consequences ("actions") onto selected agents (called "sprites") and backgrounds (called "stages") creating interactive animations, presentations, stories, and games. In an afternoon our junior programmer recreated the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong">classical arcade game Pong</a> in Scratch and <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/TheRocketScientist/2936007">shared it</a> on the Scratch web site. Assembling the code (which is a more apt description as opposed to writing the code) is reminiscent of building with LEGO blocks and in a matter of hours we were having discussions about the virtues (and dangers) of "forever loops", x-y coordinates and angles.

In most Canadian schools <a href="http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/09/06/back-to-school-request-teach-the-kids-to-code/">computer programming is not introduced until in high school</a> (and typically only as an elective subject). Skillful and efficient computer programming is not that different from reading and writing. After all, you program using a computer <em>language </em>using<em> syntax </em>and<em> statement</em>. Imagine being introduced to reading and writing in high school rather than in Grade 1. Most people would not be very good readers if we introduced to these important skills this late. I would argue that computer programming is a very important skill, a skill that children should start practicing and mastering at the same time they start reading and writing. It is important, not because everyone should aspire to become a computer programmer when they grow up (just like most people who learn to write do not become writers), but because it involves a wide facet of skills, from reading and writing to math and physics. Developing a computer program obviously requires the programmer to be able to read and write, it helps children to grasp and apply mathematical concept (coordinate systems, angles, trigonometry), it exposes them to engineering (by enabling them to build virtual and interacting structures), it allows them to experiment with physical phenomena (how does a bouncing ball behave?) and how humans interact with computers (if you try the Pong game you'll soon discover a little idiosyncrasy that it has in its human interface that increases its difficulty).

In light of what we learned from our Scratch hackathon Wikipedia's definition of programming should be revised along the following lines:
<blockquote>“…the process of designing, writing <strong>or assembling</strong>, testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code of computer programs. This source code is written <strong>or built</strong>  in one or more programming languages. The purpose of programming is to create a set of instructions that computers use to perform specific operations or to exhibit desired behaviors. The process of <del>writing</del> <strong>developing</strong> <strong>source code </strong><del>often</del> <strong>only</strong> requires <del>expertise</del> <strong>patience and an insatiable curiosity about the application domain.</strong> <del>in many a different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms and formal logic</del>. <strong>Deep expertise in subjects such as specialized algorithms or formal logic is not required.</strong>”</blockquote>
In the end we had a lazy Sunday but the hackathon was certainly not lazy, instead it was a wonderful learning experience and an eye opener. We will certainly continue exploring computer programming using Scratch and are already looking forward to our next hackathon.

<div>The classical arcade game Pong implemented by a 7 years (ok, ok, almost 8 years) young programmer in an afternoon. Best of all, no quarters are needed. Click on the image and take it for a spin. :-)  Up and down arrows control left player and 'w' and 's' controls right player. Yes, it is backwards on purpose to keep you on your toes (not because 7 year old got confused with left and right ;-) )</div>
