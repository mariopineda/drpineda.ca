<p>This summer I will be running two, week-long robotics summer camps for students ages 9-14 at a local Edmonton school. In these exciting and innovative camps young <em>LEGO</em> aficionados will be working in small teams using their creativity and problem solving skills to design, build and program a <em>LEGO</em> Mindstorms robot to solve a specific challenge. At the end of the week the robots will compete in a tournament followed by a grand celebration of our accomplishments.</p>

<p>This camp will be a sort of miniature and accelerated version of the <a href="/projects/fll/first.html"><em>FIRST LEGO</em> League (FLL) program</a> providing the participants with a solid foundation in <em>LEGO</em> robotics and programming, paving the way for greater things to come (e.g. <a href="/projects/fll/first.html">participation in the various <em>FIRST</em> program</a>).</p>

<dt>Kids; Why should you participate in this camp?</dt>

<br />
<dt>Parents; Why should you send your child to this camp?</dt>
<dd>This camp introduces children to real-world engineering challenges allowing your child to develop their teamwork and problem solving skills in a fun and creative environment. Robot building and programming sessions will be alternated with physical fitness activities. Our <a href="http://5064.ca/">in-house high school robotics team</a> will be at hand helping out and demonstrating their awesome <a href="http://5064.ca/robot/">competition robot</a>. The topics covered during the camp connect to and extend numerous units in the Alberta Program of Study for Grades 3-8 (<a href="/projects/fll/team.html">see list here</a>).
