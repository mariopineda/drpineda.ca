This summer I will be running two one week long robotics summer camp for students ages 9-14. During the camp young LEG ninjas will be working in small teams using their creativity and problem solving skills to design, build and program a LEGO Mindstorms robot to solve a specific challenge. At the end of the week the robots will compete in a tournament.

This camp will be a sort of miniature version of the FIRST LEGO League (FLL) program and will provide a great foundation for any child interested in participating in this program. 

During the camp robot building and programming sessions will be alternated with physical fitness activities.

<h2>A message for young LEGO ninjas</h2>
Do you love LEGO? Do you find robots super cool? Interested in the FLL program? What are you waiting for - this is you chance of getting your toes wet and laying a solid foundations for future robots.
