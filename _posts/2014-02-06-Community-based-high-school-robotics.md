Over the last few years I have been involved as a mentor in FIRST robotics programs for children. FIRST, aka [For the Recognition of Science and Technology](http://www.usfirst.org/), is a US-based non-profit organization aiming to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders, by engaging them in exciting mentor-based robotics programs that build science, engineering and technology skills.

One of the teams I am coaching is a high-school robotics team, [Opcom Robotics](https://www.facebook.com/teamopcom), participating in this years [FIRST Robotics Competition](http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc)(FRC).

Last week a reporter from the Edmonton Examiner visited Opcom Robotics at our HQ and in today's issue of the Edmonton Examiner there is [an article on the Opcom FRC team](http://www.edmontonexaminer.com/2014/02/05/in-its-first-frc-challenge-edmonton-team-opcom-robotics-faces-challenges-2). The write-up provides an accurate and concise summary of some of the trials and tribulations of a rookie FRC trying to building a basketball playing robot in six weeks in order to compete in the [Western Canada FRC Regionals](http://frcwest.com/) in April.
