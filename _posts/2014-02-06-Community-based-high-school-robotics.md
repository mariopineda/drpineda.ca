Over the last few years I have been involved as a mentor in FIRST robotics programs for children. FIRST, aka [For the Recognition and Inspiration of Science and Technology](http://www.usfirst.org/), is a US-based non-profit organization aiming to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders, by engaging them in exciting mentor-based robotics programs that build science, engineering and technology skills.

One of the teams I am coaching is a high-school robotics team, [Opcom Robotics](https://www.facebook.com/teamopcom), participating in this years [FIRST Robotics Competition](http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc)(FRC).

Last week a reporter from the Edmonton Examiner visited Opcom Robotics at our HQ and in today's issue of the Edmonton Examiner there is [an article on the Opcom FRC team](http://www.edmontonexaminer.com/2014/02/05/in-its-first-frc-challenge-edmonton-team-opcom-robotics-faces-challenges-2). The write-up provides an accurate and concise summary of some of the trials and tribulations of a rookie FRC trying to building a basketball playing robot in six weeks in order to compete in the [Western Canada FRC Regionals](http://frcwest.com/) in April.

In the above picture from the Edmonton Examiner, other than showing this week's blistering cold-snap, one of our talented students-engineers is trouble-shooting the control systems of the robot, where, as the article points out, we were in a bit of a pickle due to missing parts (all accounted for now though). Although the  challenge is..., well, challenging, it is also an incredible learning opportunity for both the students and the mentors alike. It is about engineering, programming, designing, testing, redesigning, fund raising, thinking outside the box, team work, friendly competition and having tons of fun. FIRST refers to the FRC program as the "hardest fun you will ever have" and, yeah, half way through the build, I am starting to think that they might be right.
