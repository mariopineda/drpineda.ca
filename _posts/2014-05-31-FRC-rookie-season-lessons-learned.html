<p>As the 2014 FRC season is wrapping up the time has come to reflect on the past season and our experiences as a rookie team. Hopefully this write-up may be useful for other FRC teams that are gearing up for their first competition season.</p>

<p>In retrospect the overarching lesson from our rookie season is that we clearly had no idea what we were getting ourselves into back in December (before the kick off). FRC is bigger than life and requires much more than technical skill and computer programming savviness from a team in order to be successful. While the FRC competition is pitting itself as a Sport for the Mind, in reality it is much more than that. Participating in the FRC program is an entirely unique experience that pushes students and mentors to the limits of their intellectual, physical and mental abilities. </p>

<p>As it turns out, upon closer inspection most of the important lessons learned during our rookie season fall under the umbrella of the <a href="http://www.firstlegoleague.org/mission/corevalues"><em>FIRST</em> Core Values</a>. While naively one may perhaps think that as students become older the Core Values are embraced more readily and will require less effort to implement, early on in the season it became apparent, however, that this is not necessarily the case. On the contrary, the Core Values can not be taken for granted even for adult mentors and coaches. Our societies is not build on the premises of the <em>FIRST</em> Core Values and as a result, to most of us, this mindset is quite foreign. To successfully implement the Core Values requires humility and an ability to acknowledge that while we all have different personalities, skills and expertise we are all also required to practice the <em>FIRST</em> Core Values at all times, which can be surprisingly difficult when personalities clash and stress levels rise.</p>

<p>So without further ado, here are some of the lessons our team learned during our rookie season from the perspective of the <em>FIRST</em> Core Values:
<ol>
<li><strong>We are a team.</strong> Team work does not come naturally. Working as a team requires practice, substantial amount of effort and a willingness to take initiatives, particularly when one is under a time crunch and in stressful situations, e.g. the build or competition season.</li>
<li><strong>We do the work to find solutions with guidance from our coaches and mentors.</strong> Enthusiastic mentor and coaches were critical during our rookie season and were the catalysts driving learning and motivation among the students. Mentors and coaches need to be concious, however, of ensuring that their contributions to the team always remain focused on helping students learn and guiding them towards finding solutions and not do the learning for the students or finding the solutions for them. </li>
<li><strong>We know our coaches and mentors don't have all the answers; we learn together.</strong> Both students and mentors need to be aware that no one has all the answers to challenges facing the team and that sometimes the solutions to the most vexing problems can come from unexpected directions.</li> 
<li><strong>We honor the spirit of friendly competition.</strong> FRC may be competitive but even in the midst of the hectic build season and during the tournament other FRC teams stepped up and graciously provide assistance, advice, tools and spare parts when approached. </li>
<li><strong>What we discover is more important than what we win.</strong> FRC is really about learning, discovery and pushing the limits of what one and the team is capable of achieving under strict time lines and on a budget. The real reward for participating in the FRC program and the tournament are all the non-tangible skills that students and mentors acquired, e.g. ability to function in high-pressure scenarios, team working skills and Gracious Professionalism.</li>
<li><strong>We share our experiences with others.</strong> Sharing our learning and experiences is central to our team throughout the season. We have taken our robot to schools and community outreach events to showcase our team, connect with like-minded students and adults and to build awareness and interest of the FRC program. Because we have received an overwhelmingly positive response from adults and students of all ages outreach has become one of the most rewarding activities we have been engaged in and we are working actively on organizing more such opportunities. </li>
<li><strong> We display Gracious Professionalism and Coopertition in everything we do.</strong> Gracious Professionalism is key to everything what <em>FIRST</em> represent and throughout our rookie season we have seen innumerable manifestations of this Core Value. </li>
<li><strong>We have fun!</strong> Participating in the FRC program as a student or as a mentor is deeply meaningful and satisfying. Whether the robot works the way it was intend to or not, as long as we have fun it is all good. </li>
</ol>

<p>Other than these lessons there are obviously many others, perhaps more mundane and technical lessons we have learned during our rookie season. Briefly,
<ul>
<li>Keep robot design and simple and robust. Complexity begets a propensity for breaking.</li>
<li>Do not oversimplify team organization. All team members need to know what is expected of them and what their roles are in the team.</li>
<li>Do not expect team members to know what is expected of them unless they are told. (See previous point)</li>
<li>When the going gets tough, do not be afraid to use some elbow grease.</li>
<li>Do not underestimate the utility of a <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=greaseman">grease man/woman</a>.</li>
<li>Do not underestimate the importance of a team image with an oomph. You really do need swag (buttons, etc.), "uniform" (aka team t-shirt), banners, a well-thoughtful and elaborate pit, and a team logo that can be carved into metal to build team identity, branding, team spirit to attracts students, mentors and sponsors.</li> 
<li>Do not try to have your robot do everything. A robot of all trades is the master of none. Instead focus on designing, building and programming a robot that is really good at a few things (e.g. catching, throwing , tackling, blocking).
<li>When all else fails, reach out to other teams and ask for help.</li>
<li>Be resourceful when things go wrong. The FRC is a challenge in every imaginable respect. While designing, building, programming and devising competition strategies are key challenges facing all teams; team organization and coordination, e.g. scheduling, project management, the logistics of the kick-off and competition are more demanding than what they may appear and it is no small order for a rookie team to stay on top of all these miscellaneous tasks. Hence the utility if a grease man/woman.</li>
</ul>
