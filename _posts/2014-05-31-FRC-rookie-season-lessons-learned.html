<p>As the 2014 FRC season is wrapping up the time has come to reflect on the past season and our experiences as a rookie team. Hopefully this write-up may be useful for other FRC teams that are gearing up for their first competition season. In retrospect the overarching theme of our rookie season experience is that back in December last year (before the kick off) we clearly had no idea what we were getting ourselves into. FRC is bigger than life and requires much more than technical skill and computer programming savviness from a team in order to be successful. While the FRC competition is pitting itself as a Sport for the Mind, in reality it is much more than that. Participating in the FRC program is an entirely unique experience that pushes students and mentors to the limits of their intellectual, physical and mental abilities. </p>

<p>For anyone that has experience with the JrFLL and FLL programs, the FRC program is the next natural step. While each of these <em>FIRST</em> programs is unique, FRC stands out with bigger robots, bigger budgets, bigger teams and larger than life challenges. One of the more subtle differences, however, which is easy to overlook, is the apparent lack of emphasis on the <a href="http://www.firstlegoleague.org/mission/corevalues"><em>FIRST</em> Core Values</a> in the FRC program. In the JrFLL and FLL  the <em>FIRST</em> Core Values are the corner stones of the programs teaching participants that friendly competition and mutual gain are not separate goals, and that helping one another is the foundation of teamwork. Team members are required to memorize the Core Value and they are recited at the beginning of each tournament. None of this happens in FRC. While the FRC program has <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc/awards">an award for Gracious Professionalism</a>, which is one of the core values, the ball seems to stop there. While the reasoning for this apparent lack of emphasis of the <em>FIRST</em> Core Values in the FRC program is not clear, what is abundantly clear after our rookie season, however, is that the Core Values are as important to a successful FRC team as they are to the other <em>FIRST</em> programs. Let's briefly refresh our memory of what the <em>FIRST</em> Core Values are:</p>

<ul>
<li>We are a team.</li> 
<li>We do the work to find solutions with guidance from our coaches and mentors.</li>
<li>We know our coaches and mentors don't have all the answers; we learn together.</li> 
<li>We honor the spirit of friendly competition.</li>
<li>What we discover is more important than what we win.</li>
<li>We share our experiences with others.</li>
<li>We display Gracious Professionalism and Coopertition in everything we do.</li>
<li>We have fun!</li>
</ul>

<p>As it turns out, upon close inspection most of the important lessons learned during our rookie season fall under the umbrella of the <em>FIRST</em> Core Values. While naively one may perhaps think that as students become older the Core Values are embraced more readily and will require less effort to implement early on in the season it became apparent, however, that this is not the case. On the contrary, the Core Values can not be taken for granted even for adult mentors and coaches. Our society is not build on the premises of the <em>FIRST</em> Core Values and as a result to most of us this mindset is quite foreign. To successfully implement the Core Values requires humility and an ability to acknowledge that while we all have different personalities, skills and expertise we are all also required to practice the <em>FIRST</em> Core Values at all times, which can be surprisingly difficult when personalities clash and stress levels rise.</p>

<p>So without further ado, here are some of the lessons our team learned during our rookie season from the perspective of the <em>FIRST</em> Core Values:
<ol>
<li><strong>We are a team.</strong> Team work does not come naturally. Working as a team requires practice, substantial amount of effort and a willingness to take initiatives, particularly when one is under a time crunch and in stressful situations, e.g. the build or competition season.</li>
<li><strong>We do the work to find solutions with guidance from our coaches and mentors.</strong> Enthusiastic mentor and coaches were critical during our rookie season and were the catalysts driving learning and motivation among the students. Mentors and coaches need to be concious, however, of ensuring that their contributions to the team always remain focused on helping students learn and guiding them towards finding solutions and not do the learning for the students or finding the solutions for them. </li>
<li><strong>We know our coaches and mentors don't have all the answers; we learn together.</strong> Both students and mentors need to be aware that no one has all the answers and solutions to challenges facing the team and that sometimes the solutions to the most vexing problems can come from unexpected directions.</li> 
<li><strong>We honor the spirit of friendly competition.</strong> FRC may be competitive but even in the midst of the hectic build season and during the tournament other FRC teams stepped up and graciously provide assistance, advice, tools and spare parts when approached. </li>
<li><strong>What we discover is more important than what we win.</strong> FRC is really about learning, discovery and pushing the limits of what one and the team is capable of achieving under strict time lines and on a budget. The real reward for participating in the FRC program and the tournament are all the non-tangible skills that students and mentors acquired, e.g. ability to function in high-pressure scenarios, team working skills and Gracious Professionalism.</li>
<li><strong>We share our experiences with others.</strong> Sharing our learning and experiences is central to our team throughout the season. We have taken our robot to schools and community outreach events to showcase our team, connect with like-minded and to build awareness and interest in the FRC program. Because we have received an overwhelmingly positive response from adults and students of all ages outreach has become one of the most rewarding activities we have been engaged in and we are working actively on organizing more such opportunities. </li>
<li><strong> We display Gracious Professionalism and Coopertition in everything we do.</strong>Gracious Professionalism is key to everything what <em>FIRST</em> represent and throughout our rookie season we have seen innumerable manifestations of this Core Value. </li>
<li><strong>We have fun!</strong> Participating in the FRC program as a student or as a mentor is deeply meaningful and satisfying and as long as we have fun we are doing things right. Whether the robot works the way we intend to or not, as long as we have fun it is all good. </li>
</ol>

<p>Other than these lessons there are obviously many others, perhaps more mundane and technical lessons we have learned during our rookie season. Briefly,
<ul>
<li>Keep robot design and simple and robust. The more complex something is the more ways it can break.</li>
<li>Do not oversimplify team organization. All team members need to know what is expected of them.</li>
<li>Do not expect team members to know what is expected of them unless they are told. (See previous point)</li>
<li>When the going gets tough, do not be afraid to use some elbow grease.</li>
<li>Do not underestimate the utility of a <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=greaseman">grease man/woman</a>.</li>
<li>Do not underestimate the importance of a team image with an oomph. You really do need swag (buttons, etc.), "uniform" (aka team t-shirt), banners, a well-thoughtful and elaborate pit, and a team logo that can be carved into metal to build team identity, branding, team spirit to attracts students, mentors and sponsors.</li> 
<li>Do not try to have your robot do everything. A robot of all trades is the master of none. Instead focus on designing, building and programming a robot that is really good at a few things (e.g. catching, throwing , tackling, blocking).
<li>When all else fails, do not be shy to reach out and ask for help.</li>
<li>Be resourceful when things go wrong. The FRC is a challenge in every imaginable respect. While designing, building, trouble shooting, programming and devising strategies are typically presented as key challenges facing teams, team organization and coordination, e.g. scheduling, project management, the logistics of the kick-off and competition are more demanding than what they may appear and it is no small order for a rookie team to stay on top of all these miscellaneous tasks, hence the utility if a grease man/woman.</li>
</ul>
