<p>A few days ago a new version of <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> was unveiled, <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/introducing-raspberry-pi-model-b-plus/">the B+ version</a>. I have been bidding my time waiting to acquire on of these remarkable pieces of hardware for quite some time now, not sure what I was waiting for, but the release of this revised and improved version was the final straw. A quick email to my local <a href="http://www.active123.com/">electronics supplier</a> confirmed that they got a shipment of the B+ the same day it was released (very impressive). To make  along story short..., one hour later and after spending some spare change I was home with a brand new and shiny RPi B+, a power adapter, wifi dongle, and a HDMI cable. While I though I had a good idea of what to expect from the RPi B+ little did I know that I was in for some pleasant surprised. </p>

<p>What is a Raspberry Pi anyway?</a>

<p>Firstly, while I have installed and configured Linux more times than I can count over the years it is safe to say that setting up <a href="http://www.raspbian.org/">Rasbian</a>, a Linux Debian distribution optimized for the Raspberry Pi hardware, was by far the fastest, simplest and smoothest Linux installation I have ever experienced. My RPi was up and running and fully configured with wifi dongle and all in no time at all.</p>

<p>Second, while the Raspberry Pi may appear as being somewhat underpowered with it's 512MB RAM and 700MHz processor, with the right operating system (namely Raspbian) it is surprisingly spiffy and if you forgo the graphical user interface and stick to command line goodness then you have a quite capable mini workstation at your disposal.</p>

<p>The real challenge with the Raspberry Pi is to figure out what to do with it, there possibilities are endless and it is hard to even figure out where to start.</p>
