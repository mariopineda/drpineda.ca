<p>Please welcome our newest classroom tenant. <a href="http://drpineda.ca/new-classroom-tenant.html">Over the long weekend our long anticipated bearded dragon arrived</a>. We have been working on setting up its new home for quite some time now. Bearded dragons make great lizard pets, they are friendly, curious and diurnal (which means that are mosta active during the day) but they have some very specific habitat requirements and it is important to have everything set up the right way ahead of time. Our bearded dragon does not have a name yet (we will collect suggestions from 8P and 7W) and it is too young to be sexed. Judging from its size it is probably around 2 months young. In the wild bearded dragons grow to over a foot in length and live for about 10 years.</p>
