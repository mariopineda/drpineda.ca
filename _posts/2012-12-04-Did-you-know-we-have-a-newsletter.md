Did you know we have a newsletter? We cannot blame you if you did not know since the first issue came out yesterday. You can find it <a href="http://us5.campaign-archive2.com/?u=7ee452410af66285cb3097b5d&amp;id=105fce0512&amp;e=8e2c39bef1">here</a>.

Every quarter, we'll bring you the latest news about data analytics and R from MPK Analytics and from around the web. We'll include tips and tricks on using R for data analytics, feature blog posts and publications and information about services and initiatives from the team at MPK Analytics. This newsletter is for you, so let us know what you think by sending us feedback at my email address below. If you find this newsletter valuable, forward it to your friends. And if you have received this newsletter from a friend, you can subscribe here to get your own copy.  Enjoy!

All the issues of the newsletters will be archived <a href="http://mpkanalytics.com/newsletters/">here</a>.
