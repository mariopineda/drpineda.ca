MPK Analytics will be attending the <a href="http://www.cybera.ca">Cybera</a> <a href="http://www.cybera.ca/summit2012">Cyber Summit</a> on October 1-3 at the Banff Centre in the beautiful Canadian Rockies. This event, with the tag line <em>Leading the Way in the Age of Big Data</em> is designed to appeal to the growing technology and innovation community in western Canada, with a mix of general and technical speakers and sessions. Sessions include presentations on <a href="http://www.cybera.ca/summit2012/schedule/opening-plenary">data as the  next oil</a>, <a href="http://www.cybera.ca/summit2012/schedule/raw-data-refineries">raw data refineries</a>, <a href="http://www.cybera.ca/summit2012/schedule/big-data-healthcare">big data in health care</a>, and much more.

Aside from mingling with the brainy crowd and attending the presentations I will also be giving a <a href="http://www.pecha-kucha.org">Pecha Kucha</a> presentation. Pecha Kucha, aka 20x20, is a somewhat unconventional presentation format where you show 20 images, each for 20 seconds. The images advance automatically and you talk along to the images. Although it sounds deceptively simple I suspect it might actually take quite some practice to master to prepare and deliver the presentation.

Finally, in the spirit of progressive social media usage I will be live tweeting and blogging the event (barring any unexpected hardware or network issues). Keep your eyes peeled for the <a href="https://twitter.com/i/#!/search/?q=%23cybersummit2012&amp;src=hash">#cybersummit</a> hash tag and/or follow the action at our twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/MPKAnalytics">@MPKAnalytics</a> and blog.
