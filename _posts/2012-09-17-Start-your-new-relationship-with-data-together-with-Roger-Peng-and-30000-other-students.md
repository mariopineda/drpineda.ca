A week from today (on September 24) <a href="https://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a>,  an education technology company committed to making education freely available to any person who seeks it, is launching their online course "<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/compdata">Computing for Data Analysis</a>" by <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/">Professor Roger D. Peng</a> of the <a href="http://www.jhsph.edu">Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health</a>.

The aim of this course is to cover the fundamental computing skills necessary for effective data analysis in R. The choice of R is no mere coincidence. Aside from being the most popular and most powerful tool for data analysis today, Roger Peng is well-known within the R community for his advocacy of reproducible computational research. He has published numerous papers on the topic, including in the journal <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22144613">Science</a>. He is also a contributor at the <a href="http://simplystatistics.org">Simply Statistics blog</a>.

Since the class is online I assume that it cannot get full (at least not in theory). In an email today from Roger, so far, 30000 students have enrolled in the course. This speaks for itself. Data analytics with R is not only in vogue but is also the tool of the choice for the next generation of data analysts. So, if you have ever contemplated about getting into R, if you are a R newbie or even a R guru, why don't you join me and 30000-some other students in this remarkable opportunity to start a new relationship (or get a novel perspective to an existing relationship) with data, data analytics and R under the guidance of one of the masters of the trade.
