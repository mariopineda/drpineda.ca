title: The summer of MOOC
description: How do we engage student in math class? While mathematics ultimately is a powerful tool helping us to understand the nature of our universe presenting math this way is likely not going to make students excited and engaged. One way of making mathematics more authentic for students is by presenting students with real world open ended problems.

Although I finished my classes about a month ago the learning, of course, never stops.  

and over the last week I have been pouring over MOOCs (aka Massive Open Online Courses) to further find courses relevant to my interests and professional development. In the end I settled for the following three summer courses at <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>:

<a href=-"https://www.coursera.org/course/amnhevolution">Evolution: A Course for Educators</a>

<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/tinkering">Tinkering Fundamentals: A Constructionist Approach to STEM Learning!</a> starting on June 19 and runs for 6 weeks

Tinkering activities provide a powerful way to inspire students' interest, engagement, and understanding in science. The Tinkering Fundamentals course will help educators and enthusiasts develop a practice of tinkering and making. This course will focus on key design elements of high-quality, science-rich tinkering activities, effective facilitation strategies and environmental organization.

<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/atc21s">Assessment and Teaching of 21st Century Skills</a> starting June 30 and runs for 5 weeks

Learn about ways to assess and teach new and emerging 21st century skills: we cover the nature of these skills, alternative methods of assessment, interpretation and reporting of assessments, and their implications for teaching. 

<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/1styearteachingms-hs">First Year Teaching (Secondary Grades) - Success from the Start</a> starts on July 21 and runs for 4 weeks
