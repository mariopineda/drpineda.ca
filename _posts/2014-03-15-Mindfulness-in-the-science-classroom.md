<blockquote>
In any weather, at any hour of the day or night, I have been anxious to improve the nick of time, and notch it on my stick too; to stand on the meeting of two eternities, the past and future, which is precisely the present moment; to toe that line. - Henry David Thoreau (Walden)
</blockquote>

Thoreau's quote describes mindfulness as walking on a narrow and ever changing ridge with the void of the past on one side, the void of future on the other side and with the fleeting ephemeral "now" at the intersection of these voids. The goal of mindfulness is thus to be fully in the present by moving along the narrow and ever changing ridge that defines the present. 

Some of the greatest scientists in history have 

As a scientist and educator I set out on this art project to explore how I could imbue mindfulness into science education.

Ridge-walking as a physical activity
Ridge-walking as mindfulness
Ridge-walking in science

This quote resonates deeply with me as, whenever the opportunity has presented itself, I practice the physical act of ridge walking, i.e. hiking along the line that marks the very top of mountains where you can climb no more and you are surrounded by a void on either side of you. Ridge walking is necessarily an mindful activity, both because of the breathtaking beauty of your surrounding making it difficult to think about anything else and because of the potential dire consequences a single misstep could have. I have chosen to study Thoreauâ€™s writing for this assignment because of the connection between the intangible and tangible description of mindfulness that the quote provides and the connection to the natural world that his writing has without resorting to dogma, myth, mysticism, super natural phenomena or theology.

Nature is not, of course, always benign and beautiful. It can be frightening and terrifying also. - Henry David Thoreau (Walking)

<blockquote>
It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us. These laws, taken in the largest sense, being Growth with Reproduction; inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct action of the external conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of Increase so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a consequence to Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of Character and the Extinction of less-improved forms. Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved. - Charles Darwin (On the Origins of Species, 1859)
