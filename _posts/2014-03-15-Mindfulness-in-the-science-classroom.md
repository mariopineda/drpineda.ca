<blockquote>
In any weather, at any hour of the day or night, I have been anxious to improve the nick of time, and notch it on my stick too; to stand on the meeting of two eternities, the past and future, which is precisely the present moment; to toe that line. - Henry David Thoreau (Walden)

Nature is not, of course, always benign and beautiful. It can be frightening and terrifying also. - Henry David Thoreau (Walking)

On a slow train through China: mindfulness as a physical journey
I propose to explore the writings of Henry David Thoreay, and in particular his Walden, in the context of mindfullness as a inward journey
 
 - a pilgrimage, not towards a physical location, but rather towards an untanginble and persoanl inner space.

In any weather, at any hour of the day or night, I have been anxious to improve the nick of time, and notch it on my stick too; to stand on the meeting of two eternities, the past and future, which is precisely the present moment; to toe that line. ~ Henry David Thoreau, Walden

It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us. These laws, taken in the largest sense, being Growth with Reproduction; inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct action of the external conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of Increase so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a consequence to Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of Character and the Extinction of less-improved forms. Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.

It is 1992 and I am in a hard seat coach somewhere in central China. After two months of traveling on a shoestring I find myself as the only westerner on a slow train to a megacity that does not exist on western maps. It is in the middle of the night and after 18 hours I am about half way to my destination. The train is packed to the brim with people, many so exhausted that they are sleeping standing up. Those that are not sleeping are smoking, drinking green tea and spitting on the floor. The lights are glaring and the air is saturated with the smell of perspiring bodies and cigarette smoke. Although I have been awake for the last 30 hours, I have not eaten, drunk or gone to the washroom for almost 20 hours  I am awake, more awake than I have had been ever before. Despite what appears to be a full catastrophy scenario I am at peace, calmly toeing the invisible and ephemeral line between two bottomless abysses of the past and the future. Time has slowed down and I am acutely aware of my surrounding, the sights, the sounds, the smells. I am not enjoying my experience but I am also not disliking it - I am just part of the fabric of the experience. I am a thread, a threat that does not judge or feel pleasure or discomfort, a threat that just exists.

 Fast forward a few years to 1997. I am part of a buddhist order in central Stockholm practicing loving kindness meditation. I am cultivating my mindfulness like it would be precious orchid in a greenhouse with carefully monitired and adjusted temperature, humidity and light.
