title: Thanks to EPL you can now have your Raspberry Pi and eat it too  
description: With the introduction of the take-home Raspberry Pi Starter Kit the Edmonton Public Library has outdone itself again. There seems to be no end in sight to how EPL is reinventing their role as a community library. No wonder it was awarded the Library of the Year prize.

<p>There are many reasons why the <a href="http://www.epl.ca/">Edmonton Public Library (EPL)</a> has been awarded <a href="http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2014/06/awards/2014-galelj-library-of-the-year-edmonton-public-library-transformed-by-teamwork/">the Library of the Year</a> prize, the first Canadian library to win the award.  One of the reasons, at least in my mind, clearly must be that one is able to sign out <a href="http://epl.bibliocommons.com/item/show/1176104005_raspberry_pi_starter_pack#sthash.hRJblI1X.dpuf">Raspberry Pi Starter Kits</a> (not to mention <a href="http://www.epl.ca/makerspace">the EPL Makerspace</a> with 3D printers, Book binding machines and much more)..., whoever said that libraries are just about books? These days, most libraries offer more than books to their patrons, but Raspberry Pi kits is definitely outside the box making a great library a role-model library. There seems to be no end in sight to how EPL is reinventing their role as a community library.</p>

The wired Raspberry Pi is <a href="http://drpineda.ca/one-juicy-fruit.html">my first device</a> is set up as a sandbox and wireless printer server for the household. The EPl RPi kit contains a whole bunch of goodies: 1 Raspberry Pi Model B (512MB RAM) ; in box (17 x 25 x 7 cm) +,1 case, 1 USB micro-b cable, 1 power adapter, 1 USB TTL console cable, 1 adapter card, 1 Adafruit Pi Cobbler kit, 1 GPIO cable, 1 USB microSD card reader, 1 full-size breadboard, 1 set breadboarding wires, starter pack parts (3 small pushbuttons, 1 each of red, green, and blue LED, 5 10K resistors, 5 560 ohm resistors, 1 Light-sensitive resistor photocell, 1 uF capacitor) 1 ethernet cable.</figcaption>
