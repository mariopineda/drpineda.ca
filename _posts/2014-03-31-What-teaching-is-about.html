The <a href="https://education.alberta.ca/department/policy/standards/teachqual.aspx">Teaching Quality Standard</a> issued by <a href="https://education.alberta.ca/">Alberta Education</a> describe the knowledge, skills and attributes required by certified teacher in Alberta. While it is mandatory reading for all Alberta teachers it might not be widely read by the general public. While I would recommend anyone that has an interest in education, e.g. parents and students, to read this document to gain a better understanding of what teaching in Alberta is about, an alternative way of conveying the gist of the document is by turning it into a word cloud.

Much of the words that pop out make complete sense of course. It is worth noting, however, the special significance the word <em>learning</em> has in not only the Alberta Teaching Quality Standard but for all good and successful teachers. According to the document teachers are <em>career-long learners</em>. I would rephrase this to <em>life-long learners</em>, which may appear as a subtle difference, but it is an important difference. Teachers as life-long learners implies that teachers develop and adapt their teaching in the light of professional development, learning taking place in the classrooms (here learning refers to the teacher learning from their students) and from learning taking place outside the school as members of their community, humans and parents. The last paragraph of the Alberta Teaching Quality Standard sums it up nicely,
<blockquote>
Teachers guide their actions by their overall visions of the purpose of teaching. They actively refine and redefine their visions in light of the ever-changing context, new knowledge and understandings, and their experiences. While these visions are dynamic and grow in depth and breadth over teachersâ€™ careers, the visions maintain at their core a commitment to teaching practices through which students can achieve optimum learning.
