<p>Science classrooms are unique as far as classrooms go. They are not only a place of learning and discovery, but also a place where curiosity is sparked, where new interests are ignited and unique experieces can place. It was during my teacher practicum that I first experienced what the remarkable potential science classrooms have to become a place of true inspiration and nourishment for curiosity. During my practicum I spend five weeks in a middle school classroom inhabited by a handful of species other than humans, including turtles, frogs and lizards. I experienced first hand how these animals allowed students to ask questions they otherwise would not have thought of and to connect their first hand experiences with exotic animals with processess that they either had never seen before or only on nature shows. By the end of the practicum it was clear to me that one way a science classroom can engage students at range of levels is by providing opprtunities to interact with animals. This experience planted a seed in my mind that rapidly sprouted once I had my own science classroom. Below are just a few examples of things that only happen in a science classroom, in this case, specifically my classroom over the last few months.
