Welcome to the blog of MPK Analytics - the consulting and training company whose mission it is to help clients in academia, industry and government to transform their data into insight using the power of R. MPK Analytics started as an idea. A simple idea to harness R, the most powerful and versatile software environment for statistical programming and graphics, to analyze, visualizes and report real-world data. The company started as a way to serve clients globally from a wide range of industries that are passionate about data, transparent and reproducible analytics, gorgeous visualizations, R, and open source.

Data is permeating our world and influencing all aspects of our society and lives. This ever-increasing volume and complexity of data has resulted in rapid growth of data analytics, the systematic computational extraction of knowledge and insight from data. At the forefront of this development is R, which has emerged as a de facto standard among statisticians for the development of statistical software and among analysts for the analysis and visualization of large and complex data sets.

This blog is the clearinghouse for all things related to R and analytics, particularly any topic that falls at the interface.
