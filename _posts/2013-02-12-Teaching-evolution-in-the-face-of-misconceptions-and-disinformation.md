Today Darwin is turning 204 years old and while many of us are celebrating his great achievements there is also a more somber side to this day. After Darwin published his theory of evolution almost 154 years ago it rapidly became the accepted scientific theory for explaining the origins of biological diversity. While evolutionary biologists still debate about the finer details of the evolutionary process there is no controversy whatsoever about the validity of the theory as a whole. Despite this, it remains controversial and plagued by misconceptions among the general public. This in itself is one important reason why we need to continue drawing attention to Darwin's birthday to promote science literacy and dispel misconceptions.

It is never to early to start promoting science literacy.

Scientific literacy starts in school (or preferably even earlier) and, unfortunately, so do <a href="http://therocketscientists.ca/2013/02/12/teaching-evolution-in-alberta-classrooms/">some misconceptions about evolutionary biology</a>. As a teacher, how do you teach natural selection and adaptation when even the text books <a href="http://therocketscientists.ca/2013/02/12/teaching-evolution-in-alberta-classrooms/">get it wrong sometimes</a> or purposefully <a href="http://ncse.com/rncse/19/5/oklahoma-textbook-committee-adopts-evolution-disclaimer">convey ambiguity and erroneous information</a>? Well, for one, as a teacher you do not need to use the textbook, or as my EDSE 352 instructor said, "The textbook is not the Program of Study!". My mentor teacher, Ms. H., embodied this idea last week when she decided to forgo using the chapter on astronomy in her grade 9 textbook because it was outdated (e.g. still classifying Pluto as a planet even though it was kicked out of the planetary club seven years ago) and had her students do a project on the topics covered in the unit. Obviously, <a href="http://therocketscientists.ca/2013/02/12/teaching-evolution-in-alberta-classrooms/">as my recent post clearly shows</a>, teachers have a need for resources on natural selection and evolution that are more carefully vetted than run-of-the-mill textbooks.

A few notable resources with teaching material on evolution are worth mentioning;
<ul>
	<li>The <a href="http://sciencecases.lib.buffalo.edu/cs/"><em>National Centre for Case Study Teaching in Science</em></a> provides a amazing trove of case studies for teaching any topic in science. The resources for teaching evolutionary biology at the <a href="http://sciencecases.lib.buffalo.edu/cs/collection/results.asp?search=&amp;subject_headings=Evolutionary+Biology&amp;educational_level=High+school&amp;type_methods=&amp;topical_areas=&amp;x=29&amp;y=7">senior</a> high school level is extensive and covers a broad range of concepts, from classical case studies such as <a href="http://sciencecases.lib.buffalo.edu/cs/collection/detail.asp?case_id=550&amp;id=550">Darwin's Finches and Natural Selection</a>, to topics with strong Science, Technology and Society (STS) links such as <a href="http://sciencecases.lib.buffalo.edu/cs/collection/detail.asp?case_id=584&amp;id=584">Evolution of Human Skin Colour</a>, to case studies on <a href="http://sciencecases.lib.buffalo.edu/cs/collection/detail.asp?case_id=269&amp;id=269">Why Sex is Good</a> (scientifically speaking).</li>
	<li>The <a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu">University of California Museum of Palaeontology</a> web site <a href="http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/evohome.html">Understanding Evolution for Teachers</a> is not just a source of information and lesson plans but also provides a virtual roadmap for how to approach teaching evolution in classrooms. For example, one of the first stops on the roadmap is <a href="http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evosite/start.shtml">Nature of Science</a> (aka NoS). After all, the development of evolutionary thought is an excellent example on the nature of science and understanding NoS is fundamental to understanding what the theory of evolution actually means.</li>
	<li>The<a href="http://www.nescent.org"> National Evolutionary Synthesis Centre</a> (aka NESCent) provides <a href="http://www.nescent.org/eog/curriculum.php">curriculum resources</a> that include  lesson plans, e.g. on the transmission dynamics and evolution of influence virus (providing a direct Science, Technology and Society [STS] link) for the high school level, links to relevant resources, and a collection of video and audio recordings on the topic (including a whole pile on sticklebacks).</li>
	<li>Last but not least, if your students are using the <a href="http://education.ti.com/calculators/products/US/Nspire-Family/CX-Handhelds">TI-Nspire CX family of graphing calculators</a> Texas Instruments have developed a simulation model for these devices that allows students to model natural selection and evolution of fur coat in a population of rabbits. If the cute rabbits are considered being Snowshoe hares (which is not a far stretch considering the snow-covered ground) then this activity can link to a <a href="http://www.hww.ca/en/species/mammals/snowshoe-hare.html">uniquely Canadian social and environmental context</a> thus providing a STS connection.</li>
</ul>
