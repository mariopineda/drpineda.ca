<div class="well">
Your teacher Ms. Corrêa is in the classroom next door and you need to deliver your homework assignment to her. Since you are busy building and programming a robot this morning you decide to deliver your assignment to her by pinning it on your robot. Ms. Corrêa's classroom is just down the hall and after some estimates you figure out the distance and directions the robot will have to drive to deliver your assignment. 
</div>

The above scenario has been paraphrase from an 1984 article by Sawada that explores how robots can be used in primary grade mathematics classrooms as a tool for inquiry-based explorations. Although this particular example is intended to be a bit tongue-in-cheek it does require students to use various mathematical concepts that are covered by the <a href="https://education.alberta.ca/media/645594/kto9math.pdf">Program of Studies during the primary grades</a>, e.g. estimation, mental mathematics, distance, and direction. Sawada offers various compelling examples of how robots can be used in a primary grade mathematics classroom to enhance teaching and learning, to differentiate instruction, to personalize the learning experience and to solve authentic real-world problems. All of these aspects play a central role for effective teaching and learning and for motivating students of all abilities. If <a href="http://drpineda.ca/mathematics/2014/02/13/Mathematical-thinking.html">mathematics thinking is about understanding concepts and foster a certain way of thinking</a> (Ben-Hur, 206) and if we use computers in mathematics for tedious and repetitive calculations (<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/conrad_wolfram_teaching_kids_real_math_with_computers.html">Wolfram, 2010</a>) then robots are the physical manifestation of mathematical concepts and calculations (Sawada, 1984). What this means is that a robot becomes an physical manifestation of a students mind, or in Sawada's own words "[the robot] carries out the child's thought in the world of the child". 
 
It is remarkable that although the Sawada paper was published three decades ago, and although the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Trak">specific robotic technology</a> described in the paper is since long obsolete the ideas Sawada articulated are not only timeless but even more relevant today with robotics programs appearing in an increasing number of schools. Often, however, these students are not given the opportunity to use robots in a classroom setting until junior high school or at the high school level. Sawada argues, however, that already in the primary grades children (i.e. elementary school) can benefit by using robots in the classroom as a tool for exploring and learning about mathematical concepts. From <a href="http://drpineda.ca/programming/2012/11/27/Kids-do-programming-A-Scratch-hackathon.html">my own experience</a> children as young as 7 can learn how to program computers, when writing his paper Sawada himself had his 6 year old son program a robot, and every year tens of thousands elementary school aged children (from grades 3) participate in the <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/">FIRST robotics program</a>. Clearly, not only are elementary school students highly capable when it comes to computer programming and  robotics they also have a lot to gain by being offered the opportunity to explore mathematics through this type of technology.
 
Incorporating robotics into the mathematics education of primary grades exposes students to all the critical mathematical processes required by Education Alberta in the <a href="https://education.alberta.ca/media/645594/kto9math.pdf">Program of Study</a>, all of which are critical for good quality mathematics teaching and learning. Specifically,
<dl>
<dt>Communication</dt> 
<dd>Robotics is particularly suitable for group work (as exemplified by the various FIRST robotics programs). By having students work in groups they will learn and express their understanding of mathematical concepts through communication with peers.</d>

<dt>Connections</dt>
<dd>Sawada's robot journeys provides students with connections tangible physical real-world representations of mathematical operations and concepts. For example, the concept of addition and subtraction can be illustrated by asking students to reduce multistep programs to one line programs. For example, asking students to find a one-liner for the following program
<p><tt>
2 steps forward<br>
3 steps forward<br>
</tt></p>
students would write 
<p><tt>
5 steps forward
</tt></p>
which corresponds to \(2 + 3 = 5\). By programming and executing the two different  version versions of the program students can verify the answer, i.e. both journeys are the same, and make connections between the addition operation and displacement in the physical world.</dd>

<dt>Mental mathematics and estimation</dt>
<dd>
Programming robotic journeys is inherently an activity that requires and develops mental mathematics and estimation skills. For example, being able to visualize the  journey when devising the program requires students to be able to estimate distances (in length and time units) and turning angles.

<dt>Problem solving</dt>
<dd>
Robotics is hands-on, inquiry based solving of real-world problems, e.g. how to drive from point A to point B or how many ways can point A and point B be connected if the are located on a regular grid? Programming and mathematics involves problem solving at two levels, problem solving at the large scale overarching level, i.e. how do we solve a given problem (e.g. get from point A to B? How do I solve a specific equation?) and problem solving at the small scale level localized level (e.g. how many degrees or in what direction do I turn at this node? How do can I get rid of the unknown quantity in the denominator?). When one is utilizing a strictly algorithmic approach to problem solving, e.g. when programming (without robots) and when solving mathematical problems these are the only two levels that are present. Robotics, however, introduced a third level of problem solving, how the mathematical or programming solution interacts with the physical world. For example, to program a robot to go around a corner, mathematically and from a programming perspective it makes perfect sense to execute the following code  
<p><tt>
5 steps forward
</tt></p>.
In reality, however, it might turn out that an uneven surface or extra grippy tires will interact with the turning robot changing the actual angle the robot ends up turning. This is authentic problem solving. 
</dd>
 
<dt>Reasoning</dt>
<dd>
In his <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/conrad_wolfram_teaching_kids_real_math_with_computers.html">TED talk Conrad Wolfram</a> proposed that to really check if you understand a concept in mathematics you should write a program to do it. To do this requires mathematical reasoning in order to perform the required task analysis of the mathematical concept as it is turned into a computer algorithm. For example, what does it mean to subtract a larger number from a smaller number and how can this be represented as an algorithm? By programming a robot this particular concept can be illustrated as the net displacement of the journey the robot makes.  
</dd> 
 
<dt>Technology</dt>
<dd>
Robots and computers (which of course are required in order to program the robots) are perceived as fun and cool by students and as such provide powerful motivational forces in the classroom. As a result this type of technology is the perfect tool for connecting with students and creating and maintaining enthusiasms and ongoing interest.
</dd> 
 
<dt>Visualization</dt>
<dd>
Being able to visualize the mathematical concepts as physical manifestations in their environment is a powerful experience and gives students a sense of ownership that is difficult to achieve when doing the traditional mathematics problems with a paper and pen out of the textbook. Being able to see the results of their mathematical thinking assists students in processing information, making connections and solving problems.
