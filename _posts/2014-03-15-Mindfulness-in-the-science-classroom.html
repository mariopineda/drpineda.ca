<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
Carl Sagan <a href="http://youtu.be/1Nxw8h60PlY">once said</a>
<blockquote>
The Cosmos is all that is or was or ever will be. Our contemplations of the Cosmos stir us. There is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the grandest of mysteries.
</blockquote>

As unfathomable as the vastness of the night sky may be the origin and diversification of life over the last 3.5 billion years undoubtedly represents the most complex, intricate and wondrous process in the universe. Perhaps no one captured Carl Sagan's sentiment of contemplating the grandest of mysteries more aptly than the 1900-century naturalist Charles Darwin. In 1859 Darwin published the first edition of his seminal book The Origin of Species. This work would not only change the way we view ourselves and our role in the natural world but it also provides a profound contemplation of the magic of life. The last paragraph of The Origin of Species Darwin poetically captures the magic of life,

<blockquote>
It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us. These laws, taken in the largest sense, being Growth with Reproduction; inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct action of the external conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of Increase so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a consequence to Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of Character and the Extinction of less-improved forms. Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved. - Charles Darwin (On the Origins of Species, 1859)

As a scientist and educator I set out on this art project to explore how I could imbue mindfulness into science education.

Some of the greatest scientists in history have 

I have chosen to study Thoreauâ€™s writing for this assignment because of the connection between the intangible and tangible description of mindfulness that the quote provides and the connection to the natural world that his writing has without resorting to dogma, myth, mysticism, super natural phenomena or theology.

Contemplation and mindfulness is an journal inward, into oneself and into the present moment. Although what one finds in this inner space is unique to each individual, as a scientist and educator contemplation and mindfulness often leads towards a profound wonder and bewilderment about the magic of the cosmos. Many of the greatest minds in science, e.g. Carl Sagan, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawkins Richard Dawkins and Charles Darwin unequivocally 


Without suggesting that I am even close to the scientific prowess and brilliance of these great scientists, it is perhaps no coincidence that those individuals that are the most dedicated towards a scientific understanding of the cosmos also describe it as magical or enchanted. Perhaps it is unavoidable, that the deeper we delve into a rational and logical scientific view of the cosmos the more one becomes ... by its beauty, intricacy and complexity.

supernatural magic, such as when a deity creates our world and all its living beings,

Helios carries the sun across the sky in a golden chariot drawn by horses, there is conjuring stage magic like when a magician pulls a rabbit out of a hat, and there is the third form of magic, the magic of reality which is the sort of magic you get when you look up at the stars, or look through a microscope or hold your newborn child for the first time when the only words that come to you minds are "this is magical".

The Tree of Life painting explores the tree as a symbol of mindfulness and magic of reality.

The Tree of Life juxtaposes the simple purposeful act of moving along a branch as a metaphor for mindfulness in life where one, in Thoreau's words, "toes the line" between the two eternities, mindfulness in the view of the Natural world as a
