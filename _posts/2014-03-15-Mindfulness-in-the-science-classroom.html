<h2>Contemplative Witness Commentary</h2>
<blockquote>
<em>The cosmos is all that is or was or ever will be. Our contemplations of the cosmos stir us. There is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a great height. We know we are approaching the grandest of mysteries.</em> - Carl Sagan 
</blockquote>

As unfathomable as the vastness of the night sky is the origin and diversification of life on Earth undoubtedly represents the most miraculous and wondrous process in the universe. Perhaps no one captured <a href="http://youtu.be/1Nxw8h60PlY">Carl Sagan's sentiment</a> of contemplating the grandest of mysteries more aptly than the 1900-century naturalist Charles Darwin. In 1859 Darwin published the first edition of <em>On the Origin of Species</em> a scientific account that went on to change the very fabric of our understanding of what it means to be human and our place in Nature. Although Darwin's <em>On the Origin of Species</em> is a scientific abstract a profoundly poetic and contemplative approach shines through Darwin's writing. In the early 1990, as an graduate students, I first read <em>On the Origin of Species</em> and was utterly floored by its profoundly contemplative and poetic description of Nature and the process that has created the wondrous diversity and complexity of life. The work reflects, what Dawkins refers to as, the magic of reality, i.e. that the real world, as understood through the lens of science, has a magic of its own. This poetic magic has a quality of inspiring beauty because it is real and because we are able to understand how Nature works and our place within the web of life. Once I read <em>On The Origin of Species</em> I immersed myself in further studies of Darwin's work and  life. Two decades later, after retiring from a career as an evolutionary biologist and Darwin scholar, two artefacts from <a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/">Darwin's vast work</a> remain timeless snapshots of Darwin's poetic and contemplative view of the miracle of reality; his first (to our best knowledge) drawing of a phylogenetic tree on <a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=38&itemID=CUL-DAR121.-&viewtype=image">page 36 in Notebook B</a> which he wrote during a eight month period starting in the summer of 1837 and the last paragraph in the first edition of <em>On the Origin of Species</em>.

As a scientist and educator my aim with this project was to contemplate by way of mindfulness meditation on the nature of reality. Perhaps because of my scientific background the nature of reality invariable lead to contemplations on the magic of reality. Here I use the word "magic" and "reality" deliberately and with very specific meanings in mind. Dawkins talks about three different types of magic. There is the supernatural magic, such as when a deity creates our world and all its living beings, there is conjuring stage magic like when a magician pulls a rabbit out of a hat, and there is the third form of magic, the magic of reality which is the sort of magic you get when you look up at the stars, or look through a microscope or hold your newborn child for the first time and when the only words that come to you mind are "this is magical". It is the last meaning of the concept of "magic" that I refer to here. There are many different forms of the concept of "reality". There is the philosophical "reality" of various Eastern traditions such as Buddhism where the goal is to develop an awareness of the natural order of things, there is are "realities" of Western philosophical and scientific traditions. Here, however, I use the term to refer to life itself and the extraordinary process that has created, and still is creating, the astounding diversity and complexity we call life. My reason for placing life itself at the centre of the stage when referring to reality is that the concept of reality only arises in the minds of living organisms (possible only in the human brain). Hence reality only has a significance when perceived by an organism that can be aware of reality. More specifically, the concept of reality only exists in the confines of the though process of the (human) brain. In the absence of a brain capable of perceiving reality and the concept of reality does not exist.


I set out on this art project to explore how I could imbue mindfulness into science education.

Some of the greatest scientists in history have 

I have chosen to study Thoreauâ€™s writing for this assignment because of the connection between the intangible and tangible description of mindfulness that the quote provides and the connection to the natural world that his writing has without resorting to dogma, myth, mysticism, super natural phenomena or theology.

In Walden Thoreau represented mindfulness as walking along a narrow and every changing ridge with the void of the past on one side, the void of future on the other side and with the fleeting ephemeral "now" at the intersection of these voids. The goal of mindfulness is thus to be fully in the present by moving along the narrow and ever changing ridge that defines the present, or in Thoreau's own words:
<blockquote>
<em>In any weather, at any hour of the day or night, I have been anxious to improve the nick of time, and notch it on my stick too; to stand on the meeting of two eternities, the past and future, which is precisely the present moment; to toe that line.</em> 
</blockquote>
My meditations on the miracle of reality follows a ridge that invariable leads to the wondrous miracle that Darwin's last paragraph embodies, i.e. the origina of life and the evolutionary of biological diversification.

To me this invariable leans to

Contemplation and mindfulness is an journal inward, into oneself and into the present moment. Although what one finds in this inner space is unique to each individual, as a scientist and educator contemplation and mindfulness often leads towards a profound wonder and bewilderment about the magic of the cosmos. Many of the greatest minds in science, e.g. Carl Sagan, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawkins Richard Dawkins and Charles Darwin unequivocally 


Without suggesting that I am even close to the scientific prowess and brilliance of these great scientists, it is perhaps no coincidence that those individuals that are the most dedicated towards a scientific understanding of the cosmos also describe it as magical or enchanted. Perhaps it is unavoidable, that the deeper we delve into a rational and logical scientific view of the cosmos the more one becomes ... by its beauty, intricacy and complexity.



The Tree of Life painting explores the tree as a symbol of mindfulness and magic of reality.

The Tree of Life juxtaposes the simple purposeful act of moving along a branch as a metaphor for mindfulness in life where one, in Thoreau's words, "toes the line" between the two eternities, mindfulness in the view of the Natural world as a

A colleague of mine <a href="http://www.science.ca/scientists/scientistprofile.php?pID=444">once said that</a> <em>The diversity of life is the most astonishing thing to happen in the universe since the Big Bang, and we need to understand it better if we hope to preserve it.</em> It is only if we foster mindfulness and contemplation of the miracle of reality that we can fully embrace a loving and caring approach to Nature to whom we owe our very existence.
