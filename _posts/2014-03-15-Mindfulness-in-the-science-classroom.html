<blockquote>
<em>The cosmos is all that is or was or ever will be. Our contemplations of the cosmos stir us. There is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a great height. We know we are approaching the grandest of mysteries.</em> - Carl Sagan (<a href="/media/Carl Sagan on cosmos.mp3">audio</a>)
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>As unfathomable as the vastness of the night sky is the origin and diversification of life on Earth undoubtedly represents the most miraculous and wondrous process in the universe. Perhaps no one captured <a href="http://youtu.be/1Nxw8h60PlY">Carl Sagan's sentiment</a> of contemplating the grandest of mysteries more aptly than the 1900-century naturalist Charles Darwin. In 1859 Darwin published the first edition of <em>On the Origin of Species</em> a scientific account that went on to change the very fabric of our understanding of what it means to be human and our place in Nature. Although Darwin's <em>On the Origin of Species</em> is a scientific abstract a profoundly poetic and contemplative approach shines through Darwin's writing. In the early 1990, as an graduate students, I first read <em>On the Origin of Species</em> and was utterly floored by its profoundly contemplative and poetic description of Nature and the process that has created the wondrous diversity and complexity of life. The work reflects, what Dawkins refers to as, the magic of reality, i.e. that the real world, as understood through the lens of science, has a magic of its own. This poetic magic has a quality of inspiring beauty because it is real and because we are able to understand how Nature works and our place within the web of life. Once I read <em>On The Origin of Species</em> I immersed myself in further studies of Darwin's work and  life. Two decades later, after retiring from a career as an evolutionary biologist and Darwin scholar, two artefacts from <a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/">Darwin's vast work</a> remain timeless snapshots of Darwin's poetic and contemplative view of the miracle of reality; his first (to our best knowledge) drawing of a phylogenetic tree on <a href="http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=38&itemID=CUL-DAR121.-&viewtype=image">page 36 in Notebook B</a> which he wrote during a eight month period starting in the summer of 1837 and the last paragraph in the first edition of <em>On the Origin of Species</em> (<a href="/media/Richard Dawkins reading ORG.mp3">audio</a>).</p>

<p>As a scientist and educator my aim with this project was to contemplate by way of mindfulness meditation on the nature of reality with a particular focus on exploring the benefits of imbuing mindfulness into science education. Perhaps because of my scientific background the nature of reality invariable lead to contemplations on the magic of reality. Here I use the word "magic" and "reality" deliberately and with very specific meanings in mind. Dawkins talks about three different types of magic. There is the supernatural magic, such as when a deity creates our world and all its living beings, there is conjuring stage magic like when a magician pulls a rabbit out of a hat, and there is the third form of magic, the magic of reality which is the sort of magic you get when you look up at the stars, or look through a microscope or hold your newborn child for the first time and when the only words that come to you mind are "this is magical". It is that last meaning of the concept of "magic" that I refer to here. It clearly not a coincidence that throughout history those individuals that are the most dedicated towards a scientific understanding of the cosmos often describe it as magical or enchanted. Scientific giants such as Carl Sagan, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawkins, Richard Dawkins and Charles Darwin all have in common a mindful view of the cosmos describing is as magical, enchanted, wonderful and bewildering.</p>

<p>There are many different forms of the concept of "reality". There is the philosophical "reality" of various Eastern traditions such as Buddhism where the goal is to develop an awareness of the natural order of things, there is are "realities" of Western philosophical and scientific traditions. Here, however, I use the term to refer to life itself and the extraordinary process that has created, and still is creating, the astounding diversity and complexity we call life. My reason for placing life itself at the centre of the stage when referring to reality is that the concept of reality only arises in the minds of living organisms (possible only in the human brain). Hence reality only has a significance when perceived by an organism that can be aware of reality. More specifically, the concept of reality only exists in the confines of the though process of the (human) brain. In the absence of a brain capable of perceiving reality and the concept of reality does not exist.</p>

<p>As a contemplative witness of the magic of reality I have chosen to explore the tree as a metaphor of mindfulness and symbol of our evolutionary heritage. In the 1854 book Walden by Henry David Thoreau, Thoreau represented mindfulness as walking along a narrow and every changing ridge with the void of the past on one side, the void of future on the other side and with the fleeting ephemeral "now" at the intersection of these voids. The goal of mindfulness is thus to be fully in the present by moving along the narrow and ever changing ridge that defines the present, or in Thoreau's own words:
<blockquote>
<em>In any weather, at any hour of the day or night, I have been anxious to improve the nick of time, and notch it on my stick too; to stand on the meeting of two eternities, the past and future, which is precisely the present moment; to toe that line.</em> 
</blockquote>
It follows naturally from Thoreau's metaphor that the line between the two eternities is a series of interconnected ridge where the junctions represent crossroads between different possible contemplative paths.</p>

<p>A colleague of mine <a href="http://www.science.ca/scientists/scientistprofile.php?pID=444">once said that</a> 
<blockquote>
<em>The diversity of life is the most astonishing thing to happen in the universe since the Big Bang, and we need to understand it better if we hope to preserve it.</em> 
</blockquote>
It is only by fostering mindfulness and contemplation of the miracle of reality that we can fully embrace a loving and caring approach to Nature to whom we owe our very existence.</p>
