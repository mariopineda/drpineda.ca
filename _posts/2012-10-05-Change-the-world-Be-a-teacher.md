<blockquote>“Do not underestimate the value of education. Educate those around you; family, friends, everyone.” - Craig Mello (Nobel laureate)</blockquote>

Today it is <a class="zem_slink" title="World Teachers' Day" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Teachers%27_Day" rel="wikipedia" target="_blank">World Teachers’ Day</a>. This is event is held annually on October 5th since 1994 - when it was created by <a class="zem_slink" title="UNESCO" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=48.85,2.306&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=48.85,2.306 (UNESCO)&amp;t=h" rel="geolocation" target="_blank">UNESCO</a> - to celebrate teachers worldwide. Its aim is to mobilise support for teachers and to ensure that the needs of future generations will continue to be met by teachers.  Since its inception World Teachers’ Day has been recognized across the world through activities ranging from students writing letters to their favourite teachers to national holidays in some countries. <em>The Rocket Scientists</em> would like to join the chorus of accolades celebrating the amazing job teachers do every day in classrooms and the vital contribution they make to society. So thank you teachers for guiding our children when they cannot find their way, supporting them when they feel lost, inspiring them and helping them find and develop the ability, passion and imagination to pursue their dreams. You are shaping and changing the world, one child at a time.

Take a few minutes to take a stand for teachers and say thanks to a teacher who has made a difference in your life or in the lives of your children, or visit <a href="http://www.5oct.org/">www.5oct.org</a> to send a World Teachers’ Day e-card.
