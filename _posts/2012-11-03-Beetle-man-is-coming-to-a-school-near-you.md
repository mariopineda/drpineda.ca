Last week <em>The Rocket Scientists</em> visited a local grade 6 school to tell the students about their great <a class="zem_slink" title="Boreal forest of Canada" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boreal_forest_of_Canada" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Canadian boreal forest</a> and the tiny, but mighty, <a class="zem_slink" title="Mountain pine beetle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_pine_beetle" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">mountain pine beetle</a>. This was the second time we visited this school and unbeknownst to us we have apparently acquired the nickname "Beetle man". We also brought with us tree cookies, beetle damaged bark and wood with galleries, a plate of blue stain fungus, beetle specimens and a stereo microscope. We also brought live Alberta born beetles with us to show the students, so clearly we lived up to our nickname. We had lots of fun with the students and got many great questions. The students very intrigued that such a "cute little bug" could cause so much damage.
