Last week I visited a local grade 6 school to tell the students about their great <a class="zem_slink" title="Boreal forest of Canada" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boreal_forest_of_Canada" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">Canadian boreal forest</a> and the tiny, but mighty, <a class="zem_slink" title="Mountain pine beetle" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_pine_beetle" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">mountain pine beetle</a>. This was the second time I visited this school and unbeknownst to us I have apparently acquired the nickname "Beetle man". I also brought with me tree cookies, beetle damaged bark and wood with galleries, a plate of blue stain fungus, beetle specimens and a stereo microscope. I also brought live Alberta born beetles with us to show the students, so clearly I lived up to my nickname. I had lots of fun with the students and got many great questions. The students very intrigued that such a "cute little bug" could cause so much damage.
