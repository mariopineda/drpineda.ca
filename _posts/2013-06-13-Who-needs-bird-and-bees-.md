title: Who needs bird and bees when you have slugs and, eh, slugs?
description: Two dossen elementary school aged students rattle the ivory tower of academic research as they conduct their own research on bees solving colour puzzles and publish the results in a peer-review journal.

<p>Raking the leaves with my son recently turned out to be an opportunity for a birds and the bees, eh, I mean <a  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slug">slug</a> and a slug lesson. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermaphrodite">Hermaphroditic</a> (i.e. a slug being a boy and girl at the same time) slug meets another hermaphroditic slug in the empty inflatable splash pool, romance arises and the slime oozes as they chase each other's tails in a sluggy slimy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mating">mating dance</a>.</p>

<p>Honestly, as we were watching the slugs getting it on I have to admit that I was cautious jumping to conclusions as to the exact details of what we saw. My <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invertebrate">invertebrate</a> morphology is not exactly up to snuff. After extensive Googling it appears that slug penises indeed are <a href="http://webs.lander.edu/rsfox/invertebrates/limax.html">located on the right side of the head posterior to the bases of the two right tentacles</a>. It appears that the correct terminology for this structure is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonopore">gonopore</a> and, somehow, it serves both the male and female reproductive functions (haven't been able to wrap my head around how that works though). Regarding the round opening on the right side of the slugs (clearly visible in the picture below). Naively I thought that it would be the genital opening where the gonophore would go but evidence seems to suggest otherwise. It appears that this opening is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumostome">pneumostome</a>, a breathing pore connecting the lungs with the exterior.</p>

<p>Why trying to explain the birds and the bees when a live demonstration in the backyard is worth a thousand words. I am still, however, stumped about how they physically exchange the sperm. In this clip where <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0041003/">David Attenborough</a> is witnessing mating leopard slugs he alludes to sperm being exchanged through the gonopores.</p>

<p>My son thought everything was crystal clear and figured that the neatest thing about being a boy and a girl at the same time would be that everyone would have the same toys.</p>
