<p>Dr. Pineda's classroom is proudly presenting its first screencast on, no less than, the exciting art of calculating percents with changing wholes. Some people would call this "<a href"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blended_learning">blended learning</a>" or "<a href="http://lodgemccammon.com/flip/">flipping the classroom</a>", but in this classroom we do not use buzzwords or follow fads. Instead we focus on sound educational strategies that  benefit the students the most.</p>

<p>While the screencast is not as <a href="http://www.bozemanscience.com">polished</a> or <a href="http://www.profrobbob.com">hilarious</a> as some other ones out there, it is a start. Ultimately it will be my students that decide what works for them and the direction this pilot project will take.</p>

<p>Go ahead and watch the screencast, visit the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCucWWLMh8G6T7zt96KQd2XQ">new shiny YouTube channel</a> and post a comment, give me thumbs up (or down, if it makes you cringe) share it and subscript because you never know where this will go..., hopefully somewhere very exciting.</p>
