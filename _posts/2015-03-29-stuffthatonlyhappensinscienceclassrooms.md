title: Stuff that only happens in science classrooms
description: Science classrooms are unique learning environments unlike any other classrooms. As a matter of fact, some things only happen in science classrooms. Here is a collection of event that happened in my own science classroom over the last school year. It's a growing list, so check back for updates.

<p>Science classrooms are unique as far as classrooms go. They are not only a place of learning and discovery, but also a place where curiosity is sparked, where new interests are ignited and unique experieces take place. It was during my teacher practicum that I first experienced the remarkable potential science classrooms have to become a place of true inspiration and nourishment for curiosity. During my five weeks practicum I spend my time in a middle school classroom inhabited by a handful of species; including turtles, frogs and lizards. I experienced first hand how these animals allowed students to ask questions they otherwise would not have thought of and to connect their first hand experiences with these animals to processess that they either had experienced seen before or that they only had seen on nature shows. By the end of the practicum it was clear to me that the way a science classroom can engage students is by providing opprtunities to interact with animals. This experience planted a seed in my mind, a seed that rapidly sprouted once I had my own science classroom. Below are just a few examples of things that only happen in a science classroom, in this case, specifically my classroom over the last few months. It's a growing list, so check back for updates.</p>
