<p>Over the weekend I started setting up my classroom for a soon-to-come new classroom tenant. The prep work is in full swing, requiring some refurnishing to fit the new habitat. Without revealing too much, our new tenant will be living in a desert habitat in a 20 gallon tank,... to start with. Once it reaches adult size the tank will have to be upgraded to something substantially larger.</p>
