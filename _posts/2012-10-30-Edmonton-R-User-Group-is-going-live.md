<a class="zem_slink" title="Edmonton" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=53.5666666667,-113.516666667&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=53.5666666667,-113.516666667 (Edmonton)&amp;t=h" target="_blank" rel="geolocation">Edmonton</a> has made a name for itself as the <a href="http://canadabulldog.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/IMG_0824.49210510_std.JPG">City of Champions</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton#History">The Gateway to the North</a> and the most northern city in North America with a population of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Edmonton#Recent_history">over 1 million</a>. Recently, however, Edmonton has added yet another achievement to this list, it has become the most northerly outpost is North America having an official R useR Group. The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Edmonton-R-User-Group/">Edmonton R useR Group</a> is the first official R useR group in <a class="zem_slink" title="Alberta" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=54.5,-115.0&amp;spn=10.0,10.0&amp;q=54.5,-115.0 (Alberta)&amp;t=h" target="_blank" rel="geolocation">Alberta</a> and its aim is to bring together practitioners from industry and academia alike to exchange knowledge and experience in solving data analysis and statistical problems by using R. Our HQ is located at the <a class="zem_slink" title="University of Alberta" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=53.5244444444,-113.524444444&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=53.5244444444,-113.524444444 (University%20of%20Alberta)&amp;t=h" target="_blank" rel="geolocation">University of Alberta</a> and out next meeting is scheduled for Friday November 9 @ 3pm (see details <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Edmonton-R-User-Group/events/88966522/">here</a>).

We are hoping that the Edmonton R User Group will follow in the footsteps of <a href="http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/local-r-groups.html">other successful R User Groups</a> and to this end we are aiming to have workshops and presentations both by members and invited guests. So, if you live in or around Edmonton and are an R aficionado (or wannabe) we encourage you to join us. Although we are just starting up this is a great opportunity  to engage in discussions about what the Edmonton R User Group should do and how it can best serve its members and the R community at large. Hope to see you there.
