description: Can a pencil be more than just your average run of the mill pencil? The legendary Palomino Blackwing Perl can take a student or teacher's writing to new heights. We have taken a batch of the Pearls for a spin and are blown away by how much writing and sketching can be transformed this unassuming pencil.

<p>Grade 1-12 teachers and students belong to an increasingly elusive category of people that still can refer to them selves as professional pencil wielders. Everyone else these days seems to have gone the way of using electronic devises for their writing needs. Case in point, take a peek inside a university lecture hall and you will be hard pressed to find anyone who still uses pencil and paper for note taking. While there are obviously many benefits of taking notes on laptops and tablets it is unfortunate when technology intended to improve learning does this at the expense of basic skills such as hand writing, spelling, grammar and basic note taking skills. </p>

<p>While in most classrooms pencils are still being used both by students and teachers, most of the pencils used are cheap mass-produced tools with much to desire in terms of quality and performance. This is not necessarily all bad. Your run of the mill classroom pencil is affordable and disposable, which is a benefit in a classroom as they invariably will grow legs and run away from their righful owners. They are sort of like disposable cutlery being wielded by pencil ninjas, functional, cheap, disposable, yet functional. However, you never see a ninja wielding a plastic cutlery knife just like you never see a carpenter wielding an IKEA hammer. Imagine a pencil as equisite as a ninja's katana or the tools of the professional carpenter. Just imagine replacing your average classroom pencil with a legendary writing tool of unsurpassed quality. Yes, there is such thing? They are not easy to come and you will not find them at your local big box stores. They are not cheap eather and they are definatelly not disposable. They are the Hattori Hanz≈ç swords of discriminating pencil wielder, they are the legendary Palomino series of pencils.</p> 

<p>Recently one of the students in Dr. Pineda's Classroom had the great fortune to get his hands on a case of Palomino Blackwing Pearl pencils, the most recently released Palomino pencil. The student, inspired by one of his teachers (not Dr. Pineda mind you), found that not only did this legendary and exquisitely crafter writing utensils imbue a great sense of joy in the writing and sketching profes, but, it created an entirely different experience altogether. It is hard not to be reverent and in awe when you are doing your homework using the best pencil in the world. It is similar to going on a road trip in a lemon compared to a comportable and luxurious high performance vehicle, you might not go faster, but the trip is immensly more enjoyable. So, without further ado, her is my student's review of the legendary Palomino Blackwing Perl pencil, and as far as I can tell, the first YouTube review to date solely dedicated to reviewing this remarkably unassuming pencil.</p>
