Even though Canada adopted the metric system in 1976, many Canadians still use the imperial measuring system. Although there are many good reasons for why the <a href="http://thinkmetric.org.uk/benefits.html">metric system beats the pants of the imperial system</a> some habits are hard and the imperial system is widely used in Canada, just check the lumber section in your local hardware store or ask any Canadian how tall they are. The boys at Orange County Choppers do a great job, albeit probably unintentionally, at illustrating one of the chief disadvantages of the imperial system, namely how difficult it can be to apply it.
