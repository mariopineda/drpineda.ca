<p>Over the last few weeks I have been busy with students setting up two new habitats in our classroom; an aquarium for freshwater animals and a vivarium for a bearded dragon. Finally the days arrived. A few days ago our fish tank was ready to become inhabited and this weekend the bearded dragon habitat was ready for its new tenant.</p>

<p>The aquarium was generously provided by the <a href="http://albertaaquatica.com/">Aquarium Club of Edmonton</a> as part of their Aquariums for Schools program. The first inhabiants of the aquarium were some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaemonetes">ghost shrimps</a>, some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_catfish">Emerald Catfish</a> and a few <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_barb">tiger barbs</a>. </p>

<p>Over the long weekend our long anticipated bearded dragon arrived. By coincidence the same day we picket up our new lizard friend winter finally arrived in Edmonton with subzero windchill and blowing snow; not the best circumstance to pickup a heat loving lizard. After bundling our beardy up in our (fake) fur hat we cranked up the heat in the vehicle and "raced" back to the classroom. Our prep work payed off and our friend seemed to enjoy his/her new home right from the outset. It did not take long before we found beardie sitting in his/her food dish munching on plump mealworms and green collard.<p>
