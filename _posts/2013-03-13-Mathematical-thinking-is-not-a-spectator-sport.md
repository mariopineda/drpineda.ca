<p>Mathematical thinking is not the same as doing mathematics, at least not in the context of how mathematics typically is presented in a school setting. In most modern day school systems mathematics is presented by having student solve highly stereotypical mathematical problems. A common text book problem in high school mathematics goes something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
Farmer Bob has 210m of fencing to enclose his pig pen on all 4 sides. What dimensions should his pig pen be to enclose the largest possible area?
</blockquote>

<p>While this problem serves as a useful exercise for practising the construction and solving of quadratic equations it provides little opportunity for developing deeper mathematical thinking. The main limitations of this and similar types of problems is that students primarily rely on the lower levels of Bloom's taxonomy when working with these problems, e.g. identifying that the problem can be solved using quadratic functions and the recalling and the instrumental application of the quadratic formula (the remembering and application level in Bloom's taxonomy) (Skemp, 2006). Note that while in principle identifying quadratic functions as the mathematical concept required for this problem in principle requires a higher level in Bloom's taxonomy (the analysing level), the context of the problem, i.e. it is located in the chapter on quadratic functions in the text book, provides an obvious give away to students as to how they are expected to solve the problem, this way reducing the task to the analysing level.</p>

<p>The levels of Bloom's taxonomy that are notably absent in these types of problems are evaluating, i.e. the student makes decisions based on in-depth reflections, criticism and assessment, and creating, i.e. the creation of new ideas and information using what has been previously learned. Ultimately mathematical thinking is about extending mathematics from simply doing mathematics by recalling and applying algorithms to evaluating and creating new ideas using a conceptual understanding of mathematical concepts. This difference between the levels in Bloom's taxonomy that these types of stereotypical mathematical problems versus more open ended problem solving involve translates directly into the potential for students to develop mathematical thinking skills, or in the famous psychologist Vygotsky's words "learning precedes development, not the other way around". In other words, in order to develop mathematics thinking skill students have to be pushed out of their comfort zone of what they know (e.g. how to solve stereotypical problems) into the Zone of Proximal Development where problems are open ended requiring evaluating and creating skills. In other words, encouraging students to work at higher levels of Bloom's taxonomy in their mathematics class enable them to develop their mathematical thinking skills.</p>

<p>In the example of Farmer Bob's pig pen one possible modification could be to ask the student to "provide the best solution for maximizing the area of the pig pen given the available amount of fencing without using any of the formulas on your formula sheet" (a circular pen would have the largest area and the quadratic formula obtained by the regular polygonal pig pen can be solved by factoring). This version of the problem would require students to go beyond the 'rules without reasons' applications of formulas (Skemp, 2006) requiring them to think beyond the topic of the text book chapter exploring background knowledge and thinking outside the box.</p>

<p>What does, however, the term mathematical thinking skills mean? Although it encompasses some aspects of expertise, competence, knowledge and understanding of mathematics - all of which require cognitive thinking - its meaning is much broader than that. The five strands of what Kirkpatrick's (2001) refers to as mathematical proficiency captures the breath and depth of what mathematical thinking represents: conceptual understanding, procedural fluency, strategic competence, adaptive reasoning and productive disposition. All of these strands are critical not only for creating well-rounded learners but also for real-world problem solving. Fostering the five strands of mathematical thinking is one important aspects of the teaching and learning process. It enables the teacher to contextualize the instructions making the learning authentic and relevant to the students' own lives. Ultimately a mathematically thinking students (as opposed to mathematically "doing" students) will become a self-full filling prophesy; by providing high level contextualized mathematics instructions students develop their mathematical thinking skills. Once students have develop their mathematical thinking skills they become more proficient at applying their mathematical thinking to open ended real world problems at high levels in Bloom's taxonomy. This will further contextualize their learning enabling students to further develop their mathematical thinking skills.</p>

<p>Are there any potential disadvantages when fostering mathematical thinking in high school classrooms? From the perspective of the teacher the chief "disadvantage" is that the teacher has to be able to let go and give students more intellectual freedom without looking for a single right answer. Open ended problems, in particular drawn from the real world, often do not have one single correct solution. During the class presentation of my assignment (<a href="/resources/mathbio/introduction.html">The math of infectious diseases</a>), when I asked the class to formulate compartment models of the <a href="/resources/mathbio/lesson3.html">various infectious disease scenarios</a> it soon became apparent that groups working on the same disease had widely divergent models. None of the models were wrong, they just represented a manifestation of the different assumptions the groups made.</p>

<p>Another potential "disadvantage" of fostering mathematical thinking in high school classrooms, at least as perceived by students, is that solving problems at the highest levels of Bloom's taxonomy in the Zone of Proximal Development is hard and difficult work. Perhaps no one puts it better than Jonathan Rogness, a mathematics professor at University of Minnesota, when he in his syllabus for one his mathematics classes states:
<blockquote>
Occasionally somebody will ask me how to do well in a math class. After twenty some years of math classes, I can tell you that there is only one surefire method: do lots of math problems. This is why we assign homework; the only way to learn math is by doing math! If it makes you feel any better, I realize this isn't the most welcome advice in the world. Sometimes I don't follow it myself in my graduate courses. But it really is true. You can read something in a book and think you understand it, but you'll only know for sure if you work out some of the exercises.

	 Development of mathematical thinking takes place when students are pushed beyond the boundaries of their comfort zone of what is known and confronted by what is not known in the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD). This is where new instruction and new learning can take place. If new instructions, learning and skill sets are carefully chosen students have the opportunity to develop and deepen their mathematical thinking skills.
