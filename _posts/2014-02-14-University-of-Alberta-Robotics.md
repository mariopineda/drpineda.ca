Yesterday <a href="https://www.facebook.com/teamopcom">Opcom Robotics</a> took a brief break during the 11'th hour of the build rush and went to the University of Alberta to visit the <a href="https://www.cs.ualberta.ca/research/research-areas/robotics">robotics lab in the Department of Computing Science</a>. The graduate students in the lab showed us some cool robotics awesomeness such as autonomous robotics navigation and robots <a href="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~vis/trackDB/">recognizing and tracking objects</a>.

Obviously these sort of capabilities are well beyond what we are able to achieve for our current robot, the visit did, however, give us lots of food for thought for future seasons.

It is remarkable how we take for granted all the processing and computation that our brain is capable of performing instantaneously. One does not realize what a feat this is until you try to make a robot repeat the simplest of tasks. What appears effortless and straightforward to us, e.g. picking up a tennis ball resting on a table right in front of you, requires a tremendous amount of complex computations and clever algorithms for a robot to perform. During our visit we were presented with a tour de force of the bleeding edge of robotics algorithm research. Although we still have some way to go before robots are able to seamlessly and autonomously perform many of the tasks that are straightforward to humans there is already some pretty cool robotics technology out there.
