<p>Tomorrow (May 5) the registration for the 2014 <em>FIRST LEGO</em> League (FLL) challenge kicks off. In this year's season children between the ages of 9-14 will explore how we learn and, more specifically, how we will learn in the future. Tomorrow's registration kick off is really only a sort of soft start of this year's FLL season allowing teams to start to get organized. The actual FLL challenge will not be revealed until August 26. Our in house team <a href="projects/fll/">The STEAMpunks</a> are patiently binding their time with their <a href="projects/fll/">count down timer</a>. </p>

<p>In the mean time, however, here is a teaser of what's to come.

<p>I am probably the only one noticing this, but the flavour music in the teaser is a perfect soundtrack for The STEAMpunks FLL team. This promises to be a tremendously exciting FLL season and I and am my emerging team are really looking forward to getting started. How much time before the challenge is released? <a href="/projects/fll/">Check for yourself</a>.</p>

<p>Brace yourself for WORLD CLASS - the future of learning is today!</p>
