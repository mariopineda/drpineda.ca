As January is coming to an end the 2013 Jr.FLL season is wrapping up. This 
season I was fortunate to have the opportunity to coach two Jr.FLL teams; the 
community-based Allendale LEGO Kids and the school-based team <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=672808082770553&set=a.276199129098119.86042.178409648877068&type=1&theater">Progressive 
Academy LEGO Ninjagos</a>. While the two teams were quite different, with the Allendale LEGO Kids spending the last 10 weeks working on the challenge and having team members ranging in age between 7-10 and the Progressive Academy LEGO Ninjagos crunching through the challenge in about a week and with all the team members being 6 years young, they both had in common that their goal was to present their research and projects at the annual Jr.FLL/FLL 
Championship at NAIT. 
</p>

<p>
In is interesting to note that these two teams were the only 
Jr.FLL teams to participate in this year's championship and as far as I know were the only Jr.FLL teams in Edmonton participating in the 2013 challenge. I am hoping that <a href="http://www.firstalberta.org/">FIRST Alberta</a> will promote the Jr.FLL program in the future to improve its visibility and increase the number of community and school-based teams that participate in the program. 
</p>

Here are some of the highlights from this year's challenge; I give you the visual story of the journeys of the Allendale LEGO Kids and the Progressive Academy LEGO Ninjagos Jr.FLL teams, culminating in their meeting and sharing their experiences at the Jr.FLL/FLL Championships at NAIT on January 18.
