As January is coming to an end the 2013 Jr.FLL season is wrapping up. This 
season I was fortunate to have the opportunity to coach two Jr.FLL teams; the 
community-based Allendale LEGO Kids and the school-based team <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=672808082770553&set=a.276199129098119.86042.178409648877068&type=1&theater">Progressive 
Academy LEGO Ninjagos</a>. While the two teams were quite different, with the Allendale LEGO Kids spending the last 10 weeks working on the challenge and having team members ranging in age between 7-10 and the Progressive Academy LEGO Ninjagos crunching through the challenge in about a week and with all the team members being 6 years young, they both had in common that their goal was to present their research and projects at the annual Jr.FLL/FLL 
Championship at NAIT. 
</p>

<p>
In is interesting to note that these two teams were the only Jr.FLL teams to participate in this year's championship and as far as I know were the only Jr.FLL teams in Edmonton participating in the 2013 challenge. One can only hope that <a href="http://www.firstalberta.org/">FIRST Alberta</a> will increase the promotion of the Jr.FLL program in the future to improve its visibility and increase the number of community and school-based teams participating in the program. 
</p>

Here are some of the highlights from this year's challenge. I give you the visual story of the journeys of the Allendale LEGO Kids and the Progressive Academy LEGO Ninjagos Jr.FLL teams as they tackle the <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/node/2716">Disaster Blaster challenge</a>, culminating in their participation, meeting and sharing of their experiences at the Jr.FLL/FLL Championships at NAIT on January 18, 2014.
