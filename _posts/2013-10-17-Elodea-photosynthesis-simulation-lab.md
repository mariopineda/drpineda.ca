<p>
In this simulation lab you will be looking at the production of oxygen as a plant photosynthesizes. The rate of photosynthesis can investigated by placing Elodea, an aquatic plant commonly used in aquaria, in water with baking soda to provide carbon. The plant can then be exposed to various treatments. Oxygen is measured by counting the number of bubbles produced by the plant during a specific time interval. In this experiment you will investigate how four factors influence the rate of photosynthesis; carbon dioxide availability, light intensity, temperature and light color.

<p>
You will be working in pairs using computers to run a simulation of photosynthesis using a virtual Elodea.

The simulation web site is located <a href="/img/post_images/photolab.swf">here</a>.

<p>
Each experiments states the variable you will be investigating, but it is up to you and your group to decide how you set the other variables. Each experiment has to be thoroughly documented, i.e. you need to record all your variables, data and conclusions and any other relevant information. You can complete the worksheet in collaboration with you group but each student has to hand in their own completed worksheet at the end of the class.

<h2>Follow-up questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Based on the simulation experiments, what factors can affect the rate of photosynthesis in a plant? How do you know?</li>
<li>Given your results, describe the treatment that you think would result in the highest rate of photosynthesis. Explain why.</li>
<li>Why is it important that you keep two variables constant (such as light level and color) while you're testing how a third variable (CO2 Level) affects photosynthesis?</li>
<li>If you would do this experiment using a real Elodea plant, how could you test if the produced gas is oxygen (and not another gas, for example carbon dioxide)?</li>
</ol>
