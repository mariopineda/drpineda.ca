<!--
Recall a negative moment as an IPT mathematics student teacher or a negative moment of one of your previous mathematics teachers or professors and describe it. Use this experience to describe and comment on the nature of the teacher, highlighting some characteristics that might make mathematics teachers' role more challenging. In addition, recall a challenging moment in your own experience as a mathematics learner (at junior-high, high school or university) and describe it. Use this experience to describe and comment on the nature of the learner, underlining some characteristics that might make the mathematics learning process more complicated. Justify your arguments based on the course readings and discussions. -->

Someone once said that mathematics is not a spectator sport. Mathematics is unique among the subjects studied in school in that it is the only academic subject where mastery requires a deep and extensive understanding of the topic and a bare minimum of memorization. In light of this it is curious that a common belief among the general public seems to be that the successful study of mathematics requires "old school" rote learning and memorizing mathematical facts, e.g. the multiplication tables (<a href="https://www.change.org/en-CA/petitions/back-to-basics-mastering-the-fundamentals-of-mathematics">Tran-Davies, 2014</a>). The idea behind this approach hinges on the assumption that it is beneficial to be able to rapidly be able to recall mathematical facts when needed. While, in principle, there is nothing wrong with this assumption the problem lies in that commonly this assumption is used as an argument to justify and defend a teaching style based on memorization without context, specifically an authentic problem solving context. I this post I will present a number of scenarios from different mathematics classrooms from the perspective of both teachers and students that I have personally experience (some as a student while others as a teacher) that illustrate how this lack of an authentic problem solving context in mathematics education is a disservice to the students as it does not prepare them adequately for higher education and for future careers. 

<h2>Teacher case studies</h2>
<div class="well">
<h3>Multiplication tricks</h3>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt>Scenario:</dt>
<dd>As Ms. Fermat was introducing her grade 3 class to multiplication she described the following trick to her class. If you are multiplying five times an even number; halve the number you are multiplying by and place a zero after the number. For example, 5 x 6, half of 6 is 3, add a zero for an answer of 30. If you are multiplying five times an odd number; subtract one from the number you are multiplying, then halve that number and place five after the resulting number. For example, 5 x 7, subtract one from 7 to obtain 6, half of 6 is 3, add a five to obtain the answer of 35.</dd>
<dt>Analysis:</dt>
<dd>Whether this multiplication trick actually would make it simpler or faster to perform simple multiplications in ones head is dubious. A far more serious and insidious objection towards introducing mathematical tricks such as this to students when teaching fundamental mathematical concepts (such as multiplication) is that it provides no understanding what so ever into how multiplication works nor does it introduce any useful insights that students could generalize when solving problems. While this algorithm may make complete sense for someone well versed in multiplication for a grade 3 student that recently has encountered multiplication for the first time this trick will be indistinguishable from conjuring magic.</dd>
<dt>Modifications:</dt>
<dd>Students can be encouraged to use mental mental math skills to come up with their own tricks for multiplying numbers similarly to the mental math strategies they encountered when doing addition and subtraction. For example, the following analogous strategy can be used for solving 5 x 6. (i) Double 5 to 10, (ii) we know that skip-counting 6 times by 10 gives us 60, (iii) since we double 5 we now need to halve to 60 to et the right answer, hence 30. The usefulness of this approach, which largely is analogous to the trick, with the key difference that it actually engages the student, increases the student's  understanding of multiplication and is generalizable. For example, the student can use the same strategy for solving more challenging problems, e.g. 25 x 80; (i) 25 x 4 = 100, (ii) 100 x 8 x 10 = 8000, (iii) 8000 / 4 = 2000.</dd>   
</dl>
</div>

<div class="well">
<h3>Equation triangles</h3>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt>Scenario:</dt>
<dd>Mr. Fermat is introducing Ohms Law in his grade 9 science class. Ohms Law describes the relationship between voltage (\(V\)), current (\(I\)) and resistance (\(R\)) in DC electrical circuits and is given by \(V=I \times R\). To help his students Mr. Fermat introduces them to the equation triangle for Ohms Law (aka Ohms Law Triangle) where the arrangement of the variables in the triangle live provides a visual mnemonic for solving Ohms Law for different unknown variables.
<center><img src="/img/post_images/ohms-law1.gif"></center>
For example, to solve Ohms Law for the voltage (left most panel below) one would perform the mathematical operations involved between the remaining two variables to and so on and so forth.
<center><img src="/img/post_images/ohms-law2.gif"></center>
</dd>
<dt>Analysis:</dt>
<dd>By providing an equation triangle for Ohm's Law Mr. Fermat is not doing his students any favours and he is certainly not helping them to increase their understanding of physics, mathematics, or the close connection these two subjects have. In grade 8 students have already been introduced to solving simple linear equations (<a href="https://education.alberta.ca/media/645594/kto9math.pdf">Education Alberta, Program of Study</a>) that are identical to Ohms Law. Providing this type of visual mnemonic (there are others in both physics and chemistry, e.g. <a href="http://www.oocities.org/yourearthscience/dmv.html">the density triangle</a>, <a href="http://robertalangrant.weebly.com/forces-and-motion.html">force and motion triangle</a>, <a href="http://9-1lally.wikispaces.com/Properties+of+Waves">wave equation triangle</a>, <a href="http://scienceaid.co.uk/chemistry/applied/titration.html">Mole-concentration-volume triangle</a>, etc.) misses out on an opportunity to connect physics to mathematics that the students already are familiar with.</dd>
<dt>Modifications:</dt>
<dd>As a mnemonic representation of simple equations with only three variables, equation triangles provides no benefit over algebraic manipulation of the actual formula. These aids have no place in classroom where understanding and thinking is valued.</dd>
</dl>
</div>

<p>These case studies illustrate the antithesis of problem solving. Instead of having students develop useful and generalizable strategies for multiplying numbers or instead of connecting simple algebraic manipulations in the physics unit to mathematical concepts the students already are familiar with in these scenarios student are provided with mindless algorithms. What is the nature of the teaching process and what are some characteristics that might make mathematics teachers' role more challenging in these scenarios? In the grade 3 class where the multiplication trick was introduced the <a href="http://education.alberta.ca/media/6738143/02%20math3%20bulletin%202013-14-20130826.pdf">Provincial Achievement Tests (PAT)</a> were scheduled for later during the school year and, as a result much of the focus of the instruction was on preparing the students for these high-stakes tests. These test are timed (students have 60 minutes to answer 40 questions) and during the school year leading up to this test there often was an emphasis on completing mathematical problems under time constraints. The nature of the teaching during the school year, exemplified by e.g. the introduction of the multiplication trick, clearly showed evidence of rote learning and use of algorithms for solving problem without providing the necessary background for allowing students to develop an understanding of the underlying mathematics. From the perspective of the teacher, preparing the class for the high-stakes test is likely a stressful situation making it difficult to balance a teaching strategy for the sake of learning vs. for the sake of doing well on the test.</p>

<p>In the scenario of the equation triangles the situation was quite different. As this was a science class the teacher, while well-qualified to teach the topic at hand, was not trained to teach mathematics. The approach to using mathematical equations in physics this teacher used was likely a teaching strategy balancing the need for teaching students how to use Ohms Law and limitations in the teacher's own ability to solve equations algebraically. One of the problems with this approach is that, perhaps inadvertently,  by not explicitly connecting mathematics to this lesson an opportunity of illustrating how mathematics (in this case, solving equations algebraically) can be applied in a real world scenario has been missed with the risk of introducing the misconception to students that it would be more difficult, complicated or time consuming to solve for the unknown in Ohms Law using simple algebra (Ben-Hur, 2006; Ch. 3). The challenge for non-mathematics teachers, particularly in the sciences, is that mathematics is pervasive and it, unless the teacher is comfortable with mathematics themselves, it may be difficult to explore topics in their subject using mathematical concepts.</p>

<h2>Student case studies</h2>
<div class="well">
<h3>Unwarranted generalizations</h3>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt>Scenario:</dt>
<dd><p>A grade 10 student is working on problems involving simplification of radical expressions and encounters the following problem in her text book:</p>

<p>Simplify and provide an exact answer for \( \sqrt{50} \).</p>

<p>She proceeds by solving the problem as follows:</p>
 
<p>\( \sqrt{50} = \sqrt{25+25} = \sqrt{25} + \sqrt{25} = 5 + 5 = 10 \)</p>
</dd>
<dt>Analysis:</dt>
<dd>This example illustrates a a common mistake that I have seen students make where students over-generalize mathematical rules. In this case the rule for the product of radicals, i.e. \( \sqrt a \sqrt b = \sqrt{ab} \), where students believe that the rule is also applicable when adding and subtracting radicals, i.e. \( \sqrt a + \sqrt b = \sqrt{a+b} \) (while in reality \( \sqrt a + \sqrt b \neq \sqrt{a+b} \)).</dd>
<dt>Modifications:</dt>
<dd>When the rules for multiplication and division of radicals are introduced they typically are followed by a large number of staged practice problem where students are expected to apply only the newly introduced concepts. Often these types errors, however, occur out of context, i.e. in problems that may require different mathematical concepts altogether. One possible solution to this common misconception could be to make students explicitly aware when they can and and cannot apply these rules by interspersing the practice problems with scenarios where the rules are no applicable. This would allow students to be more mindful when solving problems and not to take possible approaches to solving mathematical problems for granted.</dd>

<h3>Addition and subtraction involving negative numbers</h3>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt>Scenario:</dt>
<dd>A grade 11 student has asked his math teacher for help to simplify \( \frac{\displaystyle 1}{\displaystyle x} \times x^3 \).
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt>[Teacher:]</dt>
<dd>What seems to be the problem?</dd>
<dt>[Student:]</dt>
<dd>I don't know how to simplify this expression.</dd>
<dt>[Teacher:]</dt>
<dd>Do you remember the exponent rules?</dd>
<dt>[Student:]</dt>
<dd>I think so, but the \(x\) is below (pointing to the \(x\) in the denominator)</dd>
<dt>[Teacher:]</dt>
<dd>Remember that \( x^{-1} \) is the same as \( \frac{\displaystyle 1}{\displaystyle x} \). You just apply this rule backwards here.</dd>
<dt>[Student:]</dt>
<dd>Oh, ok. I see, well that is easy then. (student quickly jots down) \( x^{-1} x^{3} = x^{-4} \).
<dt>[Teacher:]</dt>
<dd>Almost correct, but what do you get when you add 3 to -1?</dd>
<dt>[Student:]</dt>
<dd>-4? (student is looking at the teacher with a puzzled expression)..., or 4? (student reaches for the calculator and punches in the numbers), oh, it's 2? </dt>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>Analysis: </dt>
<dd>I always find it surprising how many students even in high school find it difficult to perform addition and subtraction involving negative numbers. This particular example also illustrates the common reliance on using a calculator for even the simplest mathematical operations.</dd>
<dt>Modifications: </dt>
<dd>Everyone gets stumped occasionally by a simple mathematical problems. The key for getting out of this type of pinch is to have good problem solving skills. The last course of action, particularly in a mathematics classroom, should be to use a calculator as this approach provides the least amount of insights not an improved understanding of how one should approach this type of problem next time. In this particular case, the student can be encouraged to try to rephrase the problem (i.e. \( -1 + 3\)) using a different wording, e.g. if it is one degree below zero and it warms up three degrees, what is the final temperature? Another possible approach might be to ask the student to draw a number line and think about if "adding 3 to -1" will result in a smaller number (\( <-1 \)) or larger number (\(>-1\)) and by how much.<dd>

What do these case studies tell us about the nature of the teacher... can we make any generalizations

What all these case studies ilustrate is a teaching approach that turn opportunities for learning and increased understanding of mathematics into algorithimc procedures requiring a minimum of thinking and understanding.

Unwarranted memorization
Rote learning (aka rote memorization)
Meaningful learning where the focus is on learning taking place in the context of relating knowledge to with previous knowledges

If we relegate mathematics education to rote learning and memorization we rob our students of the opportunity for acquiring a deeper understanding of the logic and remarkable beauty of mathematics. Instead of reaching an awareness that virtually all mathematical concepts are, in Hewitt (1999) words, necessary students will come away with the belief that mathematics is arbitrary. 

What do these case studies tell us about the nature of the student... can we make any generalizations

Ultimately the lack of understanding and lack of engagement among students when it comes to math reflects on a failure by parents, teachers and the Program of Study to engage students with meaningful and authentic material creating critical thinkers having a deep conceptual understanding of mathematics concepts rather than a superficial knowledge obtained from mindless memorization and use of calculators.

Ten rules of thumb for studying mathematics
<ol>
<li>The purpose of solving mathematical problems is to increase your understanding of mathematics, not just obtaining a solution (<a href="http://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/solving-mathematical-problems/">Terrence Tao on solving mathematical problems</a>)</li>
</ol>

obtaining a solution is only the short-term goal of solving a mathematical problem.  The long-term goal is to increase your understanding of a subject.
