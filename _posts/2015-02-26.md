<p>So I finally made it to GETCA, the <a href="http://getca.com/">Greater Edmonton Teachers' Conference</a>, after being barred last year (long story, but not all Edu students are eligible). As far as conferences go, GETCA is as traditional as one can get conference-wise (no unconferencing here)..., so in the spirit of 21st Century conferencing I am live-tweeting and live-blogging this even.
