<p>Today is <a href="http://darwinday.org/">Darwin Day</a>. This day marks the 205 birthday (February 12, 1809) of evolutionary biologist Charles Darwin. Over the years this day has evolved (unintentional pun) into a global celebration of science and reason held on or around Feb. 12. What would be a more fitting on this day than a musical tribute to one of the greatest scientists of all time.</p>

<p>For the <a href="http://www.darwinsongproject.com/">Darwin Song Project</a> <a href="http://markerelli.com/">Mark Erelli</a> composed and performed a piece entitled <a href="http://markerelli.com/index.php?page=songs&amp;category=Little_Vigils_-oparen-2010-cparen-&amp;display=1172">Kingdom Come</a>. The song is haunting and if you pay close attention to the lyrics you may realize (or not) that it is as if Darwin himself was speaking (or singing if he was into that) using Mark Erelli's voice. I don't mean this metaphorically, but quite literally.</p>

<p>Let me walk you through the lyrics, verse by verse.</p>

<blockquote>
The wasp she lays an egg<br>
'Neath a caterpillar's skin<br>
It hatches and the larva grows<br>
Feasting from within<br>
It kills the host then off it goes<br>
To sting another one<br>
Seems to me there's too much misery to believe in Kingdom Come<br>
<br>
Kingdom Come<br>
Kingdom Come<br>
Seems to me there's too much misery to believe in Kingdom Come<br>
</blockquote>

<p>This verse talks about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichneumonoidea">ichneumon wasps</a> where the female finds a host and lays an egg on, near, or inside the host's body. Upon hatching, the larval ichneumon feeds either externally or internally, killing the host when they themselves are ready to pupate. <a href="http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-2814">In a 1960 letter to the American botanist Asa Grey</a> (6 months after the publication of the first edition of the Origins of Species), Darwin expresses his concerns reconciling the habits of this species with the notion of a world created by a benevolent God.</p>

<blockquote>
With respect to the theological view of the question; this is always painful to me.— I am bewildered.— I had no intention to write atheistically. But I own that I cannot see, as plainly as others do, &amp; as I shd wish to do, evidence of design &amp; beneficence on all sides of us. <span style="color: #ff0000;">There seems to me too much misery in the world.</span> I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent &amp; omnipotent God would have designedly created the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ichneumonidæ with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars</span>, or that a cat should play with mice. Not believing this, I see no necessity in the belief that the eye was expressly designed. On the other hand I cannot anyhow be contented to view this wonderful universe &amp; especially the nature of man, &amp; to conclude that everything is the result of brute force. I am inclined to look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details, whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance. Not that this notion at all satisfies me. I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well speculate on the mind of Newton.— Let each man hope &amp; believe what he can.—
</blockquote>

<p>Lot's of quotable stuff here, including Mark Erelli's refrain.</p>

<blockquote>
I've a secret guaranteed<br>
To make the theologians squirm<br>
All it takes is time to make a man<br>
From the lowliest of worms<br>
We are not the pinnacle<br>
Nobody's chosen ones<br>
Can the minds of men be trusted with such things as Kingdom Come<br>
<br>
Kingdom Come<br>
Kingdom Come<br>
Can the minds of men be trusted with such things as Kingdom Come<br>

<p>Worms were near and dear to Darwin and his <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Formation_of_Vegetable_Mould_through_the_Action_of_Worms">The Formation of Vegetable Mould Through the Action of Worms</a></em> (aka <em>Worms</em>) was the result of extensive experiments carried out indoor in a worm-littered room. In his writings Darwin often referred to the worms as being low in biological organization.</p>

<blockquote>
Once I had a daughter<br>
She died before her time<br>
I sponged her fevered brow<br>
And cursed her bilious decline<br>
I feel her like a phantom limb<br>
Pins and needles numb<br>
Friend I cannot comprehend what makes you cling to Kingdom Come<br>
<br>
Kingdom Come<br>
Kingdom Come<br>
Friend I cannot comprehend what makes you cling to Kingdom Come<br>
Kingdom Come<br>
Kingdom Come<br>
Seems to me there's too much misery<br>
Can the minds of men be trusted<br>
I cannot comprehend what makes you cling to Kingdom Come<br>
</blockquote>

<p>This verse refers to the death Anne Elizabeth “Annie” (1841–1851) Darwin's second child and first daughter, who was diagnosed with “<a href="http://www.aibs.org/bioscience-press-releases/resources/Berra.pdf">bilious fever with typhoid character</a>”. She died at the age of 10 from tuberculosis. The death of Anne was devastating and in <a href="http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/death-of-anne-darwin">a memorial of his daughter Darwin wrote</a>:<p>

<blockquote>
We have lost the joy of the Household, and the solace of our old age:— she must have known how we loved her; oh that she could now know how deeply, how tenderly we do still &amp; shall ever love her dear joyous face. Blessings on her.—
</blockquote>

<p>Annie's death was likely a major contributing factor contributing to Darwin severing the ties with Christianity and the church.</p>

<blockquote>
I've known communion in conviction<br>
And the loneliness of doubt<br>
Does the master mark the sparrow's fall<br>
Or just let it all play out<br>
If only for your sake my love<br>
I wish I could succumb<br>
Bridge the void and join for eternity in your Kingdom <br>
<br>
Kingdom Come<br>
Kingdom Come<br>
Bridge the void and join for eternity in your Kingdom Come<br>
Kingdom Come<br>
Kingdom Come<br>
Bridge the void and join for eternity in your Kingdom Come<br>
Kingdom Come<br>
Kingdom Come<br>
Seems to me there's too much misery to believe in Kingdom Come<br>
Kingdom Come<br>
Kingdom Come<br>
Can the minds of men be trusted with such things as Kingdom Come<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Darwin was troubled by the implications of his theory and, as a consequence, held off publishing it for many years. In <a href="http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-729">an 1844 letter to J.D. Hooker</a> (15 years before the publication of The Origin of Species), Darwin compares the realization of the immutability of species as to confessing a murder,<p>

<blockquote>
At last gleams of light have come, &amp; I am almost convinced (quite contrary to opinion I started with) that species are not (it is like confessing a murder) immutable. Heaven forfend me from Lamarck nonsense of a “tendency to progression” “adaptations from the slow willing of animals” &amp;c,—but the conclusions I am led to are not widely different from his—though the means of change are wholly so— I think I have found out (here’s presumption!) the simple way by which species become exquisitely adapted to various ends.
</blockquote>

<p>And to round off, here is Mark Erelli's performance at the Shrewsbury Folk Festival where he performed this song as part of the Darwin Song Project.</p>
