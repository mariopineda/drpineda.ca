I am currently involved in the following outreach activities in science and engineering:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4"><h2>ESON</h2>
  Edmonton Science Outreach Network (ESON) Scientists and Engineers-in-the-Classroom program. Through ESON I am providing grade 7 in-class presentations on mountain pine beetles. This presentation is aligned with the Alberta Program of Study for the Trees and Forests unit. If you want me to come to your classroom you can <a href="http://www.sciencehotline.ca/">make a request through ESON</a>.
