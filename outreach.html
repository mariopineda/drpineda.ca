I am currently involved in the following outreach activities in science and engineering:

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-4"><h2>ESON</h2>
  Edmonton Science Outreach Network (ESON) Scientists and Engineers-in-the-Classroom program. Through ESON I am providing Grade 7 in-class presentations focusing on the boreal forest and mountain pine beetles. This presentation is aligned with the Alberta Program of Study for the Trees and Forests unit. If you want me to come to your classroom you can <a href="http://www.sciencehotline.ca/">make a request through ESON</a>.

  <div class="col-md-4"><h2>FIRST</h2>
  I coach various FIRST teams ranging from community and school-based Jr. FIRST Lego League teams, FIRST Lego League teams and a FIRST Robotics Competition team. 
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-4"><h2>Science Fair Judging</h2>
  I am a judge at the annual <a href="http://www.ersf.ca/">Edmonton Regional Science Fair</a> and at various other science fairs held at Edmonton schools.
