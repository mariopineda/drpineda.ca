    <p>Thank you for stopping by Dr. Pineda’s classroom! I am a math and science teacher at <a href="http://www.auroraschool.com/">Aurora Academic Charter School</a>.</p>

    <p>In my previous life I was a researcher in academia, industry and government. After almost two decades as a researcher I reached a point in my career where I realized that as much as I love doing science my true passion is in teaching and sharing my excitement and love for science, mathematics and engineering with children and youth. Somewhere in those decades I got a M.Sc. degree and, later on, a Ph.D., so that’s where the Dr. comes from.</p>

    <!-- <p>I am currently involved in the following outreach activities in science and engineering:</p> -->
