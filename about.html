    <p>Thank you for stopping by Dr. Pineda’s classroom! Currently the reference to <i>classroom</i> is a bit of a misnomer as I do not actually have my own classroom, yet. Actually I go to other teacher's classrooms attending university lectures and high school classes. I am currently a Bachelor of Education After Degree student at the University of Alberta studying to become a high school teacher in biology, science and mathematics.</p>

    <p>Before embarking on my After Degree degree I was a researcher in academia, industry and government. After 14 years as a researcher I reached a point in my career where I realized that as much as I love doing science my true passion is in teaching and sharing my excitement and love for biology and mathematics with children and youth. Somewhere in those decades I got a M.Sc. degree and, later on, a Ph.D., so that’s where the Dr. comes from.</p>

    <p>I am currently involved in the following outreach activities in science and engineering:</p>

  <div class="col-md-4"><h2>ESON</h2>
    Edmonton Science Outreach Network (ESON) Scientists and Engineers-in-the-Classroom program. Through ESON I am providing Grade 7 in-class presentations focusing on the boreal forest and mountain pine beetles. This presentation is aligned with the Alberta Program of Study for the Trees and Forests unit. If you want me to come to your classroom you can <a href="http://www.sciencehotline.ca/">make a request through ESON</a>.

  <div class="col-md-4"><h2>FIRST</h2>
    I coach a number of FIRST teams ranging including community and school-based Jr. FIRST Lego League (JrFLL) teams, FIRST Lego League (FLL) teams and a FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) team.

  <div class="col-md-4"><h2>Science Fair Judging</h2>
    I am a judge at the annual <a href="http://www.ersf.ca/">Edmonton Regional Science Fair</a> and at various other science fairs held at Edmonton schools.
