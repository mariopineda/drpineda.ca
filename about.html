<p>Thank you for stopping by Dr. Pineda’s classroom! Currently the reference to <i>classroom</i> is a bit of a misnomer as I do not actually have my own classroom, yet. Actually I go to other teacher's classrooms attending university lectures and high school classes. I am currently a Bachelor of Education After Degree student at the University of Alberta studying to become a high school teacher in biology, science and mathematics.</p>

<p>Before embarking on my After Degree degree I was a researcher in academia, industry and government. After 14 years as a researcher I reached a point in my career where I realized that as much as I love doing science my true passion is in teaching and sharing my excitement and love for biology and mathematics with children and youth. Somewhere in those decades I got a M.Sc. degree and, later on, a Ph.D., so that’s where the Dr. comes from.</p>
