<p>Thank you for stopping by Dr. Pineda’s classroom! Currently the reference to <i>classroom</i> is a bit of a misnomer as I do not actually have my own classroom, yet. Actually I go to other teachers’ classrooms to attend university lectures and high school classes. I am currently a Bachelor of Education After Degree student at the University of Alberta studying to become a high school teacher.</p>

<p>Before embarking on my B.Ed. degree I was a researcher in academia, industry and government. After 20 years of research I reached a point in my career where I realized that as much as I love doing science my true passion is teaching science to children and youth. Somewhere in those two decades I got a M.Sc. degree and, later on, a Ph.D., so that’s where the Dr. in Dr. Pineda’s classroom comes from.</p>
