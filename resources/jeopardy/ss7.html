<h2>Rules & Instructions</h2>
<p>Your teacher will assign you to a team and give your team a buzzer and a team number. Your team is allowed to use one copy of your textbook during the game.</p>

<p>Your teacher is responsible for introducing the game, reading the categories at the start of each round, reading the clues, score keeping and judging the answers. If no correct response is given to a clue your teacher will read the correct response. If a team provides the correct response to a clue, they earn the value of the clue. If they answer incorrectly, the value is subtracted from their score. </p>

<p>A team is randomly chosen to go first, and begins the game by selecting a category and monetary value (e.g. "Alberta for $100"). Your teacher then reads the clue, after which any player that knows the answer on any team can buzz in. Your teacher recognizes the first team to buzz in, and calls on that team for a response. As in the official Jeopardy game, contestants must give the response in the form of a question (for example, “Who is Albert Einstein?”).Teams are allowed to discuss responses prior to buzzing in, but all 
conversation must stop when someone buzzes in. The person that hits the buzzer must be the same person that gives the response.</p> 
 
<p>A correct response earns the dollar value of the clue, and gives the answering team the right to select the next clue. If the player gives an incorrect response or fails to answer in time (within 5 seconds after being asked for a response), that amount is deducted from the team’s score and another team may buzz in and respond. If no correct response is given, the host reads the correct response, and the team who originally chose the question maintains control of the board.</p> 

<h3>Daily Doubles</h3>
<p>There are a number of randomly distributed Daily Doubles. The Daily Double multiplies the monetary value by two (doubles it).</p>
