    <div class="col-md-10">
	  <ol>
	    <li>Before you start please read through all of the instructions (you do not have to watch the video clip just yet).</li>
	    <li><a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/">Go to the Scratch web page</a> and login using the user name and password given to you by your teacher.</li>
        <li>Create a new project and give it a name. Make sure the project name includes your own first name. For example, I would give my pong game project the following name: "Mario's game of pong".</li>
		<li>In this less on you will be creating your own version of the game pong using scratch. if you are not familiar with pong you can read more about it here:
		  <ul>
		    <li><a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong">Wikipedia</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.ponggame.org/">Pong Game</li>
			<li><a href="http://www.pong-story.com/">The story of pong</a></li>
		  </ul>
		<li><p>Before starting to program watch the first half (up to time point 5:50) of the following YouTube video (use your headphones please). This part of the video explains how one could program pong in Scratch. Note that this is just one possible way you could program the game. You are not supposed to be copying exactly what the person in the video is doing, as a matter of fact, in our version of Scratch not everything will work the way it works in the video. Use the video for pointing you in the right direction and for general programming ideas. At this point do not worry about the second half of the video describing how to count points.</p>

		</li>
		<li>Once you are ready to start programming these are the general steps you will be going through:
		<ol>
		  <li>Create and program the movements of the paddle sprites.</li>
		    <ul>
			  <li>Make sure you use "sensible" keys for controlling the paddles, for example left paddle should be controlled by keys on the left side of the key board and the right paddle should be controlled by keys on the right side of the keyboard.</li>
			  <li>Note that the way the video describes how the paddles bounce of the edges might not work properly. Think about how you can fix this potential problem.</li>
			</ul>
		  <li>Create and program the movements of the ball sprite.</li>
		    <ul>
			  <li>Make sure the "Set costume centre" is set properly</li>
			  <li>Make sure the ball sprite starts in the centre.</li>
			</ul>
		  <li>Try out your game and, once it is working properly, <strong>have it approved by your teacher.</strong></li>
		  <li>Have the ball sprite bounce of the edges and off the paddles.</li>
		  <li><strong>Once your teacher has approved your game</strong> you can either customize your games look to look like the classical pong (black background with white sprites and bouncing sounds) or you can watch the second half of the video and add counting points to your pong game.</li>
