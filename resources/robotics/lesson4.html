Pair students (one gr 4 student + one gr 5 student)
Ask students to turn of the computer screens to avoid distractions

Go over what we covered last time:
  - We programmed scratch kitty to mover in a square. 
  - Ask students to share with the class how they solved the problem.
  - Identify programming components and concepts the class used to solve the challenge during the last class, e.g. move a specific distance, rotate a specific number of degrees, loops
  
Solve the challenge on the smart board (solve it together with the class). Introduce the concept of loops (what are the benefits?, how do you use them?)
  
Introduce today's challenge:
  - Sensing the environment - what are sensors? - 
  - Remind students: to run scratch in the browser, save their programs right from the start, work in pairs but each student needs to write their own program - comment programs
  - Demo walking Russell with and without sensors
  
Set up scratch for challenge
  - Download and set up background
  - Create reset block (comment code)
  - Two approaches: trial and error (aka dumb kitty) don't do this! or sensing kitty (aka smart kitty) Do this today!
  
Once done: 
  - Introduce variables but replacing number of steps moved by a variable
  - Introduce custom blocks (i.e. functions) and revise the maze kitty code.
