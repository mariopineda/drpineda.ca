<p>In today's class you will be using a computer simulation model to study the dynamics of a SIR disease. Feel free to "play around" with the simulation, but focus on answering the following questions. You will need to hand in your written answers at the end of the class.</p>

<p>The simulation application should appear embedded below the questions on this page. If you are experiencing difficulties using the application (e.g. if it is unresponsive or you cannot see it at all), you can go directly to the site where the application is running <a href="http://glimmer.rstudio.com/smjenness/SIR/">here</a>.

<h2>Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Draw the compartment model representation of the simulation model. Label it with names of the state variables and parameters (some of the may be different from what we have used so far).</li>
<li>Formulate the mathematical model corresponding to your compartment model.</li>
<li>Which one of the scenarios from <a href="/resources/mathbio/lesson3.html">lesson 3</a> can be represented by the simulation model? Why?
<li>What effect do changes in parameter values ( \( \beta \), \(c\), \(D\) ) have on the dynamics of the disease?</li>
<li>Suppose a drug is given to infectives so that they recover more quickly than they otherwise would. What parameter in the model would this influence? What effect does it have on the dynamics of the disease?
<li>What are "vital rates"? Modify your compartment model to incorporate the processes the vital rates correspond to.</li>
</ol>
