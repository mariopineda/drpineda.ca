<p>In today's class you will be using a computer simulation model to study the dynamics of an SIR disease. Feel free to "play around" with the simulation, but focus on answering the following questions. You will need to hand in your written answers at the end of the class.</p>

<p>The simulation application should appear embedded below the questions on this page. If you are experiencing difficulties using the application (e.g. if it is unresponsive or you cannot see it at all), you can go directly to the site where the application is running <a href="http://glimmer.rstudio.com/smjenness/SIR/">here</a>.

<h2>Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Draw the compartment diagram of the model used in the simulation application, labelling it with names of the state variables and parameters (they are different from what we have used so far).</li>
<li>Which one of the scenarios from lesson 3 and 4 does this simulation application fir with? Explain why?
<li>What effect do changes in \( \beta \) have on the dynamics of the disease?</li>
<li>Suppose a drug is given to infectives so that they recover more quickly than they otherwise would. What parameter in the model would this influence? What effect does it have on the dynamics of the disease?
<li>What are "vital rates"? Modify your compartment model to incorporate the processes the vital rates correspond to.</li>
</ol>
