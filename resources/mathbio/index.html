In the class we will familiarize ourselves and explore mathematical models used to describe biological phenomena.

understand how mathematics can be used in
the analyses of natural phenomena

Multiple lessons:
1. Introduction to mathematical models in biology (this lesson)
2.
3.
...

Lesson plan
General structure of lesson: build models -> solve using CAS software -> visualize -> describe and explain

From the PoS for Math31 (p. 44)
Student Outcomes Summary
After completing this elective section, students will be
expected to construct differential equation models for
simple biological situations, and to solve those models
that involve exponential and logarithmic functions.

growth: exponential growth, growth toward a carrying capacity, predator-prey models 
decay: 
movement across a boundary
