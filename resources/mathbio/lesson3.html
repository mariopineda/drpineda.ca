#Formulating mathematical models of infectious diseases

#Your task
use capital letters for state variables (i.e. the various classes in your compartment model) and small greek letters for the parameters (i.e. rates between classes).

#Influenza (SIR)
In 1978 at a British boarding school three boys were reported to the school infirmary with the typical flu symptoms. Over the next few days, a very large fraction of the 763 boys in the school contracted the infection. Within two weeks the infection had become extinguished.

1. Formulate a compartment model of the influenza.
2. Formulate an ODE model of your compartment model.
3. Why did the influenza outbreak die out?
4. How could the compartment model be modified to account for vaccination? You do not have to formulate the ODE model corresponding to this modified compartment model.
5. Can you identify one simplifications that your model makes that is likely to affect the qualitative results?

#Gonorrhoea (SIS)
Gonorrhoea is a sexually transmitted disease where individuals are born susceptible to infection and remain so until they become sexually active. Transmission of infection, from an infected to a susceptible individual, occurs during sexual contact. Recovery from infection generally occurs only following medical treatment, after which which the individual becomes susceptible again.

1. Formulate a compartment model of gonorrhoea.
2. Formulate an ODE model of your compartment model.
3. How could the compartment model be modified to account for high and low risk groups? You do not have to formulate the ODE model corresponding to this modified compartment model.
4. Can you identify one simplifications that your model makes that is likely to affect the qualitative results?

#Tuberculosis (SICR)
Tuberculosis (aka TB) is an infectious disease caused by bacteria that typically attacks the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. It is spread through the air when people who have an active TB infection cough, sneeze, or otherwise transmit respiratory fluids through the air. Some people who suffer from the TB never completely recover and continue to carry the infection without exhibiting any symptoms. They may throughout their lives become infectious and suffer symptoms again and then relapse into a symptom-free carrier state.

1. Formulate a compartment model of tuberculosis.
2. Formulate an ODE model of your compartment model.
3. Tuberculosis can be fatal in many cases. How could the compartment model be modified to account for this? You do not have to formulate the ODE model corresponding to this modified compartment model.
4. Can you identify one simplifications that your model makes that is likely to affect the qualitative results?

#Zombie apocalypse (SIR)
A zombie is a reanimated human corpse that feeds on living human ﬂesh and is usually portrayed as being brought about through an outbreak or epidemic. According to traditional beliefs and certain Hollywood movies humans can die of either natural causes (non-zombie related causes) or by being attacked by a zombie. Humans that die of natural causes can become resurrected as zombies. Humans that are attacked by zombies can either become 'infected' and turn into zombies themselves or they can kill the attacking zombie by removing its head. Headless zombies die and cannot resurrect again. Only humans (living or dead) can become infected through contact with zombies, and zombies only have a craving for human ﬂesh.

1. Formulate a compartment model of a zombie apocalypse.
2. Formulate an ODE model of your compartment model.
3. How could the compartment model be modified to account for living humans having immunity to becoming infected by zombies? You do not have to formulate the ODE model corresponding to this modified compartment model.
4. Can you identify one simplifications that your model makes that is likely to affect the qualitative results?
