#Your task
use capital letters for state variables (i.e. the various classes in your compartment model) and small greek letters for the parameters (i.e. rates between classes).

#Influenza (SIR)
In 1978 at a British boarding school three boys were reported to the school infirmary with the typical flu symptoms. Over the next few days, a very large fraction of the 763 boys in the school contracted the infection. Within two weeks the infection had become extinguished.

1. Formulate a compartment model of the influenza.
2. Formulate a ode model of your compartment model.
3. Why did the influenza outbreak die out?

#Gonorrhoea (SIS)

Gonorrhoea is a sexually transmitted disease where individuals are born susceptible to infection and remain so until they become sexually active. Transmission of infection, from an infected to a susceptible individual, occurs during sexual contact. Recovery from infection generally occurs only following medical treatment, after which which the individual becomes susceptible again.

#Zombie apocalypse (SIR)

A zombie is a reanimated human corpse that feeds on living human ﬂesh and is usually portrayed as being brought about through an outbreak or epidemic. According to traditional beliefs and certain Hollywood movies humans can die of either natural causes (non-zombie related causes) or by being attacked by a zombie. Humans that die of natural causes can become resurrected as zombies. Humans that are attacked by zombies can either become 'infected' and turn into zombies themselves or they can kill the attacking zombie by removing its head. Headless zombies die and cannot resurrect again. Only humans (living or dead) can become infected through contact with zombies, and zombies only have a craving for human ﬂesh.

Questions:
- How could you add vaccination?
- Can you identify any simplifications that your model makes that are likely to affect the qualitative results?
