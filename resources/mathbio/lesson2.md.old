<p><em>This lesson is a modified version of the lesson <a href="http://www.edpolicystudies.ualberta.ca/en/ResearchCentresInstitutesAndNetworks/CRYSTALAlberta/Projects/MathematicalModeling/~/media/edpolicystudies/Documents/ResearchCentresInstitutesAndNetworks/CRYSTAL%20Alberta/West%20Nile%20Virus%20Modules/Part_3_The_SIS_Model_of_Disease_Transmission.pdf">The SIS Model of Disease Transmission</a> developed by Gerda de Vries (University of Alberta) and John S. Macnab (Edmonton Public School Board).</em></p>

<p>Before students can start working on developing their 
This is the final step before the students can begin working on the their own models. What we would like to accomplish here is to show how a simple model of disease transmission can be developed from a basic understanding of the derivative, and show 
how it relates to the logistic equation.</p>

<p>Imagine a closed population, where individuals neither leave nor arrive and the birth and death rates are zero. This is, roughly, what a school might be like over the course of a single semester. Let \(N\) be the size of this population.
Now suppose that one person in this population is infected with an infections non- fatal disease, such as a cold. We wish to describe the spread of the disease through the population. To do this, we divide the population into two groups:
Susceptibles: These are the healthy individuals.
Infectives: These are the people who currently carrying the disease and are capable of infecting the susceptibles.
Let S(t) be the number of susceptibles in the population at time t.
Let I(t) be the number of infectives in the population at time t.
The model is called SIS because susceptibles become infectives then recover and become susceptibles again.
