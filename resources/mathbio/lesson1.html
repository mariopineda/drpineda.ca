<blockquote>
Models come in a variety of forms - from highly complex models that (like a jet aircraft) need a range of experts to create and maintain them, to simple "toy" models that (like bicycles) can be easily understood, modified, and adapted. The decision whether to travel by bike or aircraft depends on several factors, such as time, distance, and cost.Similarly, which sort of model is the most appropriate depends on the precision or generality required, the available data, and the time frame in which results are needed. - Keeling & Rohani (2008)

<p>In this series of lessons we will be exploring simple mathematical models aimed at capturing and describing the dynamics of infectious diseases. Although the mathematics can appear difficult at times, these models are hugely simplified cartoons of extremely complex biological systems. Does this mean that the models are wrong or invalid? What are the pros and cons of using a simple model of a complex phenomenon as opposed to a highly complex model attempting to capture all the nuances of the sustem we are interested in? Can a model be too simple or too complex? As you learn more about this topic and explore some models for yourself keep these questions in the back of your mind. </p>
