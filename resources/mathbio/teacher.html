<p>This series of lessons is designed for students following the Alberta highschool Program of Studies in Mathematics 31 and are taking the applications of calculus to biological sciences elective component. These lessons focus on the application of continuous time ordinary differential equations for modelling infectious disease dynamics by using compartment models.</p>

<h2>Lesson Outline</h2>
<p>
The lessons are assumed to be 80 minutes in length each and organized as follows:<br>
<a hrer="/resources/mathbio/lesson1.html">Lesson 1</a>: Mathematical models in biology<br>
<a hrer="/resources/mathbio/lesson2.html">Lesson 2</a>: Models of infectious diseases<br>
<a hrer="/resources/mathbio/lesson3.html">Lesson 3</a>: Modelling infectious diseases<br>
<a hrer="/resources/mathbio/lesson4.html">Lesson 4</a>: Presentation of models<br>
<a hrer="/resources/mathbio/lesson5.html">Lesson 5</a>: Computer simulations of infectious diseases

<h2>Lesson Objectives</h2>
<p>The objective of these lessons is to allows students to apply grade 12 mathematics to real world biological problems thereby developing an understanding of the nature of mathematics and biology, the relationships between mathematics and biology, and the social and environmental contexts of mathematics and biology. By working independently, in groups and together as a whole class students will develop the skills required for scientific inquiry using mathematical concepts and abstractions, for solving real-world problems, for communicating mathematical and scientific ideas and results, for working collaboratively and for making informed decisions.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>The lessons integrate several subjects at different grade levels, e.g. Science 10, Biology 20-30, Chemistry 20-30 and can also be dovetailed to Social Studies. These lessons are suitable as a term-end enrichment project for more academicaly advanced classes.</p>

<p>The lessons build on learning outcomes acquired in the following high school classes tying in with the specified units: 
<ul>
<li>Mathematics 10: </li>
<li>Mathematics 20: </li>
<li>Mathematics 30: </li>
<li>Biology 20: Ecosystems and Population Change, Human Systems</li>
<lt>Biology 30: Population and Community Dynamics</li>
</ul>
<p>

Student Outcomes Summary
After completing this elective section, students will be
expected to construct differential equation models for
simple biological situations, and to solve those models
that involve exponential and logarithmic functions.

<dl>
<dt>Arousing Interest:</dt>
<dd>What is the potential to arouse student interest in the planned activities?</dd>
<dt>Student Involvement:</dt> 
<dd>How active and involved will the students be in the lesson? Are there ways that students' roles can be less passive, not limited to listening and responding to the teacher's directions?</dd>
<dt>Mathematical Understanding:</dt> 
<dd>What kind of fit or connection is there between the activity and the mathematical understanding it is intended to promote?</dd>
<dt>Fit with Curriculum:</dt> 
<dd>How clear is the fit with the curriculum? Has the planner stated it?</dd>
<dt>Clarity and Completeness:</dt> 
<dd>How clearly and effectively is the plan laid out? Can it be easily followed? Were all the materials provided? Was the planner knowledgeable and able to communicate his or her intentions for the plan?</dd>
