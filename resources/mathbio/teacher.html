This series of lessons is designed for students following the Alberta highschool Program of Studies in Mathematics 31 and are taking the applications of calculus to biological sciences elective component. 

These four lessons are intended to be part of the applications of calculus to biological sciences elective component of Mathematics 31. The lessons focus on the application of continuous time ordinary differential equations for modelling infectious disease dynamics by using compartment models. 

<h2>Lesson Outline</h2>
<p>
The lessons are assumed to be 80 minutes in length each and organized as follows:
</p>

<h3><a hrer="/resources/mathbio/lesson1.html">Lesson 1</a></h3>
Review of mathematical background
<h3><a hrer="/resources/mathbio/lesson2.html">Lesson 2</a></h3>
Introduction to compartment models
<h3><a hrer="/resources/mathbio/lesson3.html">Lesson 3</a></h3>
Development of disease specific models
<h3><a hrer="/resources/mathbio/lesson4.html">Lesson 4</a></h3>
Presentation of models
<h3><a hrer="/resources/mathbio/lesson5.html">Lesson 5</a></h3>
Explorations of epidemiological computer simulations


and allows students to apply grade 12 mathematics real world problems. This project allows students to develop an understanding of the nature of mathematics and science, the relationships between mathematics and science, and the social and environmental contexts of mathematics and science.

Students will develop the skills required for scientific inquiry using mathematical concepts and abstractions, for solving real-world problems, for communicating mathematical and scientific ideas and results, for working collaboratively and for making informed decisions.

The lessons integrate several subjects at different grade levels, e.g. Science 10, Biology 20-30, Chemistry 20-30 and can also be dovetailed to Social Studies. This WebQuest is suitable as a term-end enrichment project for more academicaly advanced classes.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
These lessons build on learning outcomes acquired in the following high school classes and tie in with the specified: 
<ul>
<li>Mathematics 10: </li>
<li>Mathematics 20: </li>
<li>Mathematics 30: </li>
<li>Biology 20: Ecosystems and Population Change, Human Systems</li>
<lt>Biology 30: Population and Community Dynamics</li>
</ul>

without vital rates
often general analytic solutions are difficult or not possible to obtain

These pages are intended as resources for the teacher and not necessarily meant to be used directly by the students (since the answers to questions are given).

<dl>
<dt>Arousing Interest:</dt>
<dd>What is the potential to arouse student interest in the planned activities?</dd>
<dt>Student Involvement:</dt> 
<dd>How active and involved will the students be in the lesson? Are there ways that students' roles can be less passive, not limited to listening and responding to the teacher's directions?</dd>
<dt>Mathematical Understanding:</dt> 
<dd>What kind of fit or connection is there between the activity and the mathematical understanding it is intended to promote?</dd>
<dt>Fit with Curriculum:</dt> 
<dd>How clear is the fit with the curriculum? Has the planner stated it?</dd>
<dt>Clarity and Completeness:</dt> 
<dd>How clearly and effectively is the plan laid out? Can it be easily followed? Were all the materials provided? Was the planner knowledgeable and able to communicate his or her intentions for the plan?</dd>
