<p>This series of lessons is intended for students following the Alberta high school Program of Studies in <a href="http://education.alberta.ca/media/645646/math31.pdf">Mathematics 31</a> and are taking the <em>applications of calculus to biological sciences</em> elective component. These lessons focus on the application of continuous time ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for modelling infectious disease dynamics using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology">epidemiological compartment models</a>. The lessons fit closely with the learning objectives (general and conceptual) of the Program of Studies for this elective component (see Learning Outcomes further down for further details).</p> 

<h2>Lesson Objectives</h2>
<p>The objective of these lessons is to allows students to apply grade 12 mathematics to real world biological problems thereby developing an understanding of the nature of mathematics and biology, the relationships between mathematics and biology, and the social and environmental contexts of mathematics and biology. By working independently, in groups and together as a whole class students will develop the skills required for scientific inquiry using mathematical concepts and abstractions, for solving real-world problems, for communicating mathematical and scientific ideas and results, for working collaboratively and for making informed decisions.</p>

The topic of these lessons, modelling of infectious diseases, is an area of active research stemming directly from real world applications. This topic is likely to arouse and maintain the students' interests as everyone is likely to be familiar with infectious disease outbreaks from their own lives, e.g. the annual influenza cycles. The activities have been chosen to maximize the opportunity for student involvement through student-directed work, either individually (Lesson 2), in small groups (Lesson 3-5) or in a whole-class context (Lesson 1).

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>The lessons integrate several subjects at different grade levels, e.g. Science 10, Biology 20-30, Chemistry 20-30 and can also be dovetailed to Social Studies. These lessons are suitable as a term-end enrichment project for more academically advanced classes.</p>

<p>The lessons build on learning outcomes acquired in Mathematics 10, 20-1 and 30-1 and the following high school classes tying in with the specified units: 
<ul>
<li>Biology 20: Ecosystems and Population Change, Human Systems</li>
<lt>Biology 30: Population and Community Dynamics</li>
</ul>
<p>

<p>It is advisable that students have already studied all of the required components of Mathematics 31 (pre-calculus and limits, derivatives and derivative theorems, applications of derivatives, integrals, integral theorems and integral applications.) before covering these lessons.</p>

<h2>Lesson Outline</h2>
<p>
Each lesson is assumed to be 80 minutes in length and organized as follows:<br>
<a href="/resources/mathbio/lesson1.html">Lesson 1</a>: Mathematical models in biology<br>
<a href="/resources/mathbio/lesson2.html">Lesson 2</a>: Models of infectious diseases<br>
<a href="/resources/mathbio/lesson3.html">Lesson 3</a>: Modelling infectious diseases<br>
<a href="/resources/mathbio/lesson4.html">Lesson 4</a>: Presentation of models<br>
<a href="/resources/mathbio/lesson5.html">Lesson 5</a>: Computer simulations of infectious diseases
</p>

<h2>Learning outcomes</h2>
These lessons are not intended to cover all the learning outcomes this elective component for Mathematics 31. The specific learning outcomes covered by these lessons (p. 44 in the Program of Studies for <a href="http://education.alberta.ca/media/645646/math31.pdf">Mathematics 31</a>) are:
<ul>
<li>After completing this elective section, students will be expected to construct differential equation models for simple biological situations, and to solve those models that involve exponential and logarithmic functions.</li>
<li>Students are expected to understand that many important biological applications of calculus are connected with models involving the solution of the differential equation \( f'(x) = k f(x) \).</li>
<li>Students will demonstrate conceptual understanding of the links between calculus and the biological sciences.
<li>Using the connections between a given problem and either a simpler or equivalent problem, or a previously solved problem, to solve the given problem.</li>
<li>Constructing mathematical models for situations in a broad range of contexts of a single real variable.</li>
</li>
</ul>

The specific mathematical processes that are the focus of these lessons are:
<ul> 
<li>Integrate communication (e.g. group and whole-class discussions and presentations) in order for students to learn and exp ress their understanding.</li>
<li>Make connections among mathematical ideas, other concepts in mathematics, everyday experiences and other scientific and social disciplines.</li>
<li>Develop mathematical reasoning.</li>
<li>Use technology as a tool for learning and for solving problems.</li>
<li>Develop visualization skills to assist in processing information, making 
connections and solving problems. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p>Opportunities to conduct formative assessments are present in Lesson 1 (whole-class discussion of video clips), Lesson 2 (individual student work on questions accompanying the mathematical theory), Lesson 3 (project work in small groups), Lesson 4 (group presentations) and Lesson 5 (individual work using simulation application).</p>

<p>Lesson 4 (presentation of group projects) provides an opportunity for summative assessment (see rubric in Lesson 4).</p>
