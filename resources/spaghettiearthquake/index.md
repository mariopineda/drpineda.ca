<h1>Spaghetti Earthquake</h1>
<p><em>"The Coolest Thing You Will Ever Do With Pasta"</em></p>

<p>Earthquakes and other natural disasters can damage or destroy man-made structures. Imagine that you and your teammates work for a company that specializes in building disaster-proof-structures. You have just been asked by city planners to design and build an earthquake proof sky scraper that will be built in a city where earthquakes sometimes occur. The city planners would like to see and test a prototype of your design along with the designs of other companies before choosing which company to go with. They will select the best design for the construction of the sky scraper. </p>

<h2>Task</h2>
<p>For this assignment your teacher will assign you to be part of teams of four students. Each team will design, build and test a prototype model structure made out of uncooked spaghetti sticks. Your final structure will be tested on a specially built earthquake machine, the <em>Destroyer 1000</em>. This machine simulates the stress that occur during earthquakes. Your structure has to be able to withstand a 10 second earthquake without collapsing. You will be competing against other teams by attempting to build the best structure. You and your teammates will give a brief presentation prior to the final test were you will discuss your Internet research and how it helped you design your structure. You will also present your blue prints and describe the various features of your structure. You will have a limited budget to purchase materials for your structure.</p>

<h2>Assigning Individual Roles</h2>
<p>Select an individual from your team to fullfill each of the following roles:</p>
* Architect: Responsible for developing the architectural drawing (blueprint) of your structure. 
* Treasurer: Responsible for financial matters for the team (e.g. budgeting, accounting, completing purchase orders, etc.) and for conducting all purchases.
* Technology Director: Responsible for managing the collection and presentation of internet research data.
* Project Manager: Responsible for obtaining and managing building materials and clean-up.

<p>Taking on any of the roles does not mean that you will do all the work. It means that you are in charge of that particular responsibility and can assign and delegate subtasks to other team members. For example, one of the responsibilities of the Technology Director is to manage the Internet Research. This means that the Technology Director has the authority to assign specific tasks of the online research to the other team members. It is the responsibility of the other team members to follow the directions of of the Technology Director and report back to him or her. </p>

<h2>Internet Research</h2>
<p>Your team will be using the Internet to research information that could assist you in your project. You should try to find websites that provide information on building structures that are able to withstand earthquakes or other natural disasters. Search for ideas that will help you engineer and design your structure.</p>

<h2>Architectual drawing</h2>
<p>Once you have researched about building safe structures it is time to draw up your blue print for the sky scraper. Each teamwill create a architectural drawink (blueprint) using 11 by 16 inch paper. Your blueprints have to be meticulously drawn (using a straight edge/ruler), to scale (the scale must be indicated), all measurements must be included, all details have to labelled and explained. The drawing must be easy to understand yet highly detailed. The final structure must closely match your blueprints or you may fail the building inspection. </p>

<h2>Building permit application</h2>
<p>Once your architectual drawings are complete your team has to apply for a building permit buy submitting the blueprint and a written one page building permit report to the City's Chief Engineer (your teacher). Your building permit report has to list all the features of the building, explain their functions and include a cost estimate using a table that lists all the materials you will need and their cost. Links to relevant internet sites supporting the proposed design has to be included.</p>

<p>Your building permit application report has to be no more that one page in length, typed and printed. The report has to be written using proper English language, grammar, punctuation and spelling. Proper technical vocabulary is required (see textbook). A sloppy and incomplete buliding permit application will be rejected forcing your team to resubmit a revised application and pay the application few again.</p>

<p>Your final structure must closelly match your blueprint and your building permit report. Only minor changes will be allowed during the building inspection. If you need to make major changes to your structure during the construction you need to revise your architectural drawings and re-apply for a new building permit.</p>

<h2>Structure Specifications</h2>
<p>Your structure can only be build using the materials purchased from <em>The Lizard & Mealworm Supply Company</em>. Your final structure has to be able to support an egg at the top of the structure. The bottom of the egg must be at least 40 cm above the table top. You will be building the structure on a cardboard base. Your structure has to be attached to the cardboard base (by tape). Design carefully! Your structure has to be strong yet flexible. Use your Internet research in your design. Failure to follow specifications or deviations from your approved blueprint may result in a failed building inspection forcing your team to revise the structure and undergo another building inspection (including paying the fee again).</p> 

<h2>Purchasing of materials</h2>
<p>All materials used for your structure have to be purchase from the <em>The Lizard & Mealworm Supply Company</em>. To purchase materials your treasurer must complete a purchase order. Purchases can only be made during opening hours (see below).</p>

<p>Note that the treasurer is responsible for keeping track of how much money the team is spending and how much money have left. For a fee (see below), the treasurer may request a bank statament to obtain the balance.</p>

<h2>Budget</h2>
<p>Your total budget for all materials is $4875. Teams exceeding their project budget will be penalized by a 10% deduction to the overall project grade for every $100 in overdraft. It is the treasurer's responsibility to keep accurate financial records and to always know exactly what your bank balance is. Failure to keep detailed and accurate records will result in fines.</p>

<p>Make a table like this to help you keep record:</p>
<table border="1" style="width:75%">
  <tr>
    <th>Date</th>
    <th>Description of purchase (include quantities)</th>
    <th>Total Cost</th>

<h2>Insurance</h2>
<p>The materials you will be using are delicate and can easily be damaged during construction or while being stored. You have the option of purchasing an insurance policy to protect you from catastrophic accidental losses. The policy will allow you to purchase and additional $1500 of materials. The cost of the policy is $500.</p>

<p>The insurance policy can be purchased from the <em>Smaug & Crickets Insurance Corporation</em> during the first day of the project. The insurance cannot be purchased after the first day.</p>

<p>You may use the policy only in the event of a catastrophic loss (major damage). You cannot use the policy for minor breaks or loss of material. The Insurance Adjustor (your teacher) will assess the severity of the damage and determine if your team is elegible for compensation. Decisions made by the Adjustor are final!</p>

<h2>Construction</h2>
<p>All team members must participate in the construction process. The Project Manager is responsible for storage of the team's structure and materials. Be careful not to waste or unneccessarily damage your materials. Clean up your area at the end of each class or your team may get fined.</p>

<h3>Construction Rules</h3>
1. Spaghetti sticks may not be broken into pieces smaller than 1cm
1. Marshmallows must remain intact. They cannot be torn or broken into smaller pieces.
1. Do not eat any of the building materials.
1. You may not tape your egg to the structure
1. You must only use the materials your team purchases in class. You may not bring your own materials or use the materials from another team.
1. You may not tape your structure to the earthquake machine.
1. The cardboard board can only be used as a base and cannot be cut or pierced in any way.

<h2>Building Inspection</h2>
<p>Once your structure is completed and before it can be tested on the shake table it has to pass a building inspection. During the building inspection your completed structure will be assessed and compared against the blueprints and the bulding permit report submitted as part of your building permit application. Your structure will also be inspected to ensure it complies with all the rules of the assignment. The team will be presented with a verbal report detailing recommended and required changes before passing the inspection. If there are any required changes the team will have to schedule a new building inspection (and pay the building inspection fee again) once the changes have been addressed.</p>

<h2>Presentation</h2>
<p>Your team will make a presentation to the class prior to the final test (2-3 min). During the presentation the team has to provide a rationale for the chosen design, specifically explaining why your design will support the egg and withstand the earthquake. You must provide the web addressess (URLs) of all the websites that you used for your final structure and presentation. During your presentation you must explain how the information provided helped you through your project and to design your project.</p>

<h2>Final Report</h2>
<p>The last part of this assignment is for each student to write an analytical report addressing the following questions:
1. Describing your the structure your team built and provide explanations for the choice of design and the various features.
2. Analyze the construction process. What went well and what mistakes were made. How can the construction process be improved.  
3. Analyze the outcome of the earthquake test. How did your structure perform and why? Did your structure fail or not and why?

<p>The report has to be written using proper English language, grammar, punctuation and spelling. Each question has to be addressed completelly in one or several well-written paragraphs. Each paragraph has to have a clear topic sentence. Proper technical vocabulary is required (see textbook).</p>

<h2>Milestones and Timeline</h2>
<p>Use the following timeline to help yu stay on track. Note that on most days only half the class time will be used for this assignment. Your are expected to work on reports and blueprints on your own time (outside of class) as well.</p>
