<h1>Spaghetti Earthquake</h1>
<p><em>"The Coolest Thing You Will Ever Do With Pasta"</em></p>

<p>Earthquakes and other natural disasters can damage or destroy man-made structures. Imagine that you and your teammates work for a company that specializes in building disaster-proof-structures. You have just been asked by city planners to design and build an earthquake proof sky scraper that will be built in a city where earthquakes sometimes occur. The city planners would like to see your design along with the designs of other companies before choosing which company to go with. They will select the best design for the construction of the sky scraper. </p>

<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Each team will design, build and test a model structure made out of uncooked spaghetti sticks. Your final structure will be tested on a specially built earthquake machine. This machine simulates the stressess that occur during earthquakes. Your model should be able to withstand a 10 second earthquake without collpasing. You will be competing against other teams by attempting to build the best structure. You and your terammates will give a brief presentation prior to the final test were you will discuss your Internet research and how it helped you design your structure. You will also show the class your blue print and describe any modifications you made. You will have a budget of $4,875.00 to purchase materials for your sky scraper.</p>

<h2>Assigning Individual Roles</h2>
<p>Select an individual from your team to fullfill each of the following roles:</p>
* Architect: Responsible for developing the architectural drawing (blueprint) of your structure.
* Treasurer: Responsible for financial matters for the team (e.g. budgeting, accounting, completing purchase orders, etc.) and for conducting all purchases.
* Technology Director: Responsible for managing the collection and presentation of internet research data.
* Project Manager: Responsible for obtaining and managing building materials and clean-up.

<p>Taking on any of the roles does not mean that you will do all the work. It means that you are in charge of that particular responsibility and can assign and delegate subtasks to other team members. For example, one of the responsibilities of the Technology Director is to manage the Internet Research. This means that the Technology Director has the authority to assign specific tasks of the online research to the other team members. It is the responsibility of the other team members to follow the directions of of the Technology Director and report back to him or her. </p>

<p>Each team will get four tags with the role titles. When working on the project in-class each team member is required to wear the tag indicating their respective role.</p>

<h2>Internet Research</h2>
<p>Your team will be using the Internet to research information that could assist you in your project. You may use the websites listed in the web links section below, or you can conduct your own research. You should try to find websites that provide information on building structures that are able to withstand earthquakes or other natural disasters. Search for ideas that will help you engineer and design your structure.</p>

<h2>Architectual drawing</h2>
<p>Once you have researched about building safe structures it is time to draw up your blue print for the sky scraper. All group members will create a sketch using standard size 8Â½ by 11 inch graph paper. Your design should be strong yet flexible. Your actual structure must closely match your original blue print. Only minor changes will be allowed. Use your internet research in your design. Your team will present their sketches to each other, discuss each proposed designs benefits and disadvantages and vote on the sketch they want to use for their sky scraper. A large scale sketch will be created by your architect using the blue print paper. You will only receive the blue print paper after you have created a rough draft of your sketch. </p>

<h2>Application for building permit</h2>
<p>Once your architectual drawings are complete your team has to apply for a building permit buy submitting the drawings and a written report to the City's Chief Engineer (your teacher). Your architectual drawings have to be meticulously drawn (using a straight edge/ruler), to scale (the scale must be indicated), all measurements must be included, all details have to labelled and explained. The drawing must be easy to understand yet highly detailed. Your report has to explain all the features of the building and explain their functions. Links to relevant internet sites supporting the proposed design has to be included.</p>

<p>Your actual structure must closelly match your drawing. Only minor changes will be allowed during the building inspection. If you need to make major changes to your structure you need to revise your architectural drawings and apply for a new building permit.</p>

<h2>Structure Specifications</h2>
<p>Your design has to be able to support an egg at the top of the structure. The bottom of the egg must be at least 40 cm above the table top. You will be building the structure on a square piece of cardboard. Your structure has to be attached to the cardboard base (by tape). Design carefully! Your structure has to be strong yet flexible. Use your Internet research in your design.</p> 

<h2>Purchasing of materials</h2>
<p>Purchase the materials needed for your structure. You must purchase all your materials from the Coco Channel Supply Company. Your treasurer must complete a purchase order and write a check for the amount of materials needed. </p>

<p>Note that the treasurer is responsible for keeping track of how much money is spent and how much money your team has left. Purchase order forms and checks will be provided by the banker (your teacher).</p>

<h2>Budget</h2>
<p>Your total budget for all materials is $4875. You may not exceed your budget. Your team will be given $1875 on the first day of the project, another $2000 when your building permit has been approved and the final $1000 two classes later. You may not exceed your budget! Exceeding your budget during the construction will result in a NSF fine. If the projects ends up exceeding the budget at its completion this will result in a 10% deduction to the overall project grade for every $100 in overdraft. </p>

<h2>Insurance</h2>
<p>The materials you will be using are delicate and can easily be damaged during construction or while being stored. You have the option of purchasing an insurance policy to rotect you from catastrophic losses. The policy will allow you to purchase and additional $1500 of materials. The cost of the policy is $500.</p>

<p>The insurance policy can be purchased from the Indian Stick Insect Insurance Corporation during the first day of the project. The insurance cannot be purchased after the first day.</p>

<p>You may use the policy only in the event of a catastrophic loss (major damage). You cannot use the policy for minor breaks or loss of material. The Insurance Adjustor (your teacher) will assess the severity of the damage and determine if your team is elegible for compensation. Decisions made by the Adjustor are final!</p>

<h2>Construction</h2>
<p>All team members must participate in the construction process. The Project Manager is responsible for storage of the team's structure and materials. Be careful not to waste or unneccessarily damage your materials. Clean up your area at the end of each class or your team may get fined.</p>

<h2>Presentation</h2>
<p>Your team will make a presentation to the class prior to the final test (2-3 min). During the presentation the team has to provide a rationale for youyr chosen design, specifically why you think your design will support the egg and withstand the earthquake. You must provide the web addressess (URLs) of all the websites that you used for your final structure and presentation. During your presentation you must explain how the information provided helped you through your project and to design your project.</p>

<h2>Milestones and Timeline</h2>

<h2>Building Inspection</h2>
<p>Once your structure is completed and before it can be tested on the shake table it has to pass a building inspection. During the building inspection your completed structure will be assessed and compared against the architectural drawings submitted as part of your building permit application. Your structure will also be inspected to ensure it complies with all the rules of the WebQuest. The team will be presented with a report detailing recommended and required changes before passing the inspection. If there are any required changes the team will have to schedule a new building inspection (and pay the building inspection fee again) once the changes have been addressed.</p>

<h2>Financial Audit</h2>
<p>A financial audit may be performed by the City's Chief Financial Officer (your teacher) at any time. During the fiancial audit the financial records of your team will be examined to ensure that they are complete and accurate. Discrepancies or errors that are discovered will result in a fine.</p>

<h2>Online Resources</h2>
<p>The web sites below are intended as good starting points. These sites may provide information that is useful to you in your structure design. You may also wish to conduct your own online research. If you use the inforamtion from a website make sure to include it in your final report and include a description of what you learned from the website and how you used it in your project.</p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>Your grade will be based on <a href="Spaghetti_Earthquake_Rubric.pdf">a grading rubric</a>. You should thoroughly review the grading rubric before you begin. Make sure you and your team mates understand what criteria will be used to determine your grade. Teams will be assessed using attached rubric. Group members will receive similar scores, but score can be reduced on an individual basis. In most cases, the team score will be the same for each member, unless individual scores are lowered due to the following issues:<p>
* Playing around in the lab area or classroom
* Not staying with group (wandering around)
* Too loud during work time
* Not participating appropriately
* Ostracizing team members
* Disturbing other teams
