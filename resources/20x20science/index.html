      <div class="panel-body">
	    <p><strong>The guts of your topic:</strong></p> The focus of #20x20science is for students to communicate the guts of a complex topic in a compelling manner and requires students to make choices about what to keep, plus what to ignore, in their presentations.</p>
	  
        <p><strong>Images over Text:</strong>  Try to use images that advance your story and illustrate your points.  When using words steer clear of bullets and use phrases that have an impact and represent the essence of your point.</p>

		<p><strong>No transitions or animation:</strong>  Avoid slide transitions and fly-in text. This eats up time and detracts from the focus of this fast-paced presentation style.</p>

        <p><strong>No video or audio:</strong>  While you can add audio and video files to your presentations they need to fit into the 20 second time frame and normally don’t work well with this presentation style.</p>

        <p><strong>Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse:</strong>  You must make sure you get your important points across and you won’t be able to do that successfully if you don’t practice.  20 seconds is a short time and every slide where you go over that time forces you to speed up on all subsequent slides to make it up.  Practice is critical.</p>
