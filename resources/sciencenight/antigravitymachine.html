    <ol>
       <li>Touch your magnet to your various materials to confirm that they’re not magnetic.</li>
       <li>Take your magnet and drop it from about the height of your pipe onto something soft.</li>
       <li>Now, drop it through your pipe or tube of aluminum foil. What do you expect to happen? What actually happens?</li>
       <li>Place your magnet on the cookie sheet and tilt the sheet so that it slides off. Does it behave oddly? Why do you think that is?</li>
       <li>Tie your magnet to the string, and swing it in a low circle so that it passes over a metal washer placed on a smooth surface. What happens to the Washer? Can you think of how this might be related to the other behavior you observed earlier?</li>

  <dt>How does it work?</dt>
  <dd>When you drop your magnet through a copper tube, it slows down. The magnet will also slide down the cookie sheet slowly, and nudge the metal washer in the direction the magnet is spinning. 
  
  Magnetic fields are the result of electric currents. Changing a magnetic field (moving a magnet) next to a non-magnetic metal will induce an electric field (a voltage difference) in the metal, which subsequently generates a magnetic field with an opposite orientation with respect to your magnet.

When your magnet moves next to a metal it creates these fields, but the fields act in a very specific way. They want to cancel out the magnetic field in the metal, because metals don’t like having electric or magnetic fields inside of them (that’s why electricity flows through metals easily—they’re trying to cancel out the difference in electric potential by moving electrons around!). This phenomenon is known as Lenz’s Law.

The magnetic field induced in the metal attracts the falling magnet, creating resistance. This resistance is what slowed down your magnet. As your magnet slows down, it stops generating as much current, which reduces the resistance acting on the magnet’s movement. Gravity speeds the magnet back up again until it reaches a happy medium speed. Basically, your magnet is creating a whirlpool of electrons around it as it falls through your pipe. Neat, huh?

	Neodymium magnets are very strong and should be handled with care since they can shatter at high velocities. Neodymium magnets of can pinch as they are attracted to other magnets or metals with great force & velocities.
