    <div class="col-md-10">
	In this activity students will use a vortex generator to shoot air vortices at cups. Be creative in how you set up the cups. 
	  <ol>
	    <li>Set up cups as targets, e.g. stack cups on the table in the shape of a pyramid, line up students with cups on their heads, etc.</li>
	    <li>Fill the vortex generator with fog. Explain to students that filling up the generator with fog just makes it easier to see the rings of air when they come out. About 2 seconds' worth of fog is plenty.</li>
		<li>Ask students to aim towards the stacked cups and tap on the membrane.</li>

    <div class="col-md-2"><strong>How it works</strong></div>
    <div class="col-md-10">
	<p>This activity is designed to get students thinking about what happens when air moves. Sometimes it is difficult to think about air and what it does because it is invisible. The vortex generator is a way to 'see' air as it interacts with objects within its 'blast zone'.</p>
	
    <p>When testing an object for its air resistance, smoke is used with a wind chamber to be able to see the air’s movements and look at the places where vortices form. A vortex is a spinning flow of fluid or gas. Water going down the drain and the air in a tornado form vortices in the shape of funnels. A vortex generator works because when the air is forced out the front of the generator, some air hits the edges of the hole and slows down. This slower air is then pulled forward by the faster moving air in the centre and starts swirling around itself in a ring. This spinning ring can travel great distances because the spin, like a frisbee’s spin, keeps it nice and stable.</p>
