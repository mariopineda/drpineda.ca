    what happens when air moves by shooting spinning doughnuts of air using an air vortex cannon.
	
  This activity is designed to get students thinking about what happens when air moves. Sometimes it is difficult to think about air and what it does because it is invisible. The air cannon is a way to 'see' air as it moves objects within its 'blast zone'.

The air that shoots out of the cannon is a vortex of air similar to rings of smoke sometimes blown by smokers.

A vortex is a spinning flow of fluid or gas. Water going down the drain and the air in a tornado form vortices in the shape of funnels. The air cannon vortex is a donut shape or, mathematically, a torus. The air in the donut rolls from the centre to the edge. The air forms this shape because the air leaving the cup at the centre of the hole is traveling faster than the air leaving around the edge of the hole. The air keeps its shape since the surrounding air is relatively slow moving (and under higher pressure).
  
  But if you've noticed, although the holes in the cannons are round they shoot smoke rings. The technical term for a donut shape is "torus," and one of these floating rings is called a toroidal vortex. Air (and smoke) are spinning from the inside of the donut to the outside, like rotating beads on a bracelet. This spin is what keeps the torus together as it moves across the room.

A good deal of the air shot by a cannon does blast straight out of the cannons as they fire. But some of the smoke gets dragged out and back by the edge of the ring out of which it was fired, and by contact with the outside air. It meets the air around it and starts curling backwards, looking like the edge of a mushroom cloud. The drag from the air and rim on one side, and the push from the smoke on the other, gets that patch of smoke to begin spinning, creating a vortex. The smoke still maintains some forward momentum, and so the ring travels across the room. If it weren't spinning, the friction of the air around it would cause it to break apart. Because it is spinning, it's moving faster than the air around it.

The Bernoulli Principle states that as air picks up speed, air pressure drops. This means that the air in the ring is at a lower pressure than the air on all sides around it. This causes the air around it to push inwards, like a giant mold, keeping the torus together as it moves. And so, smoke rings jet around, amusing and entertaining all.

Bernoullie's principle: as the spped of a liguid or gas increases the pressayre decreases
