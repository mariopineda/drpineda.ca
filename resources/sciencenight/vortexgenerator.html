    <div class="col-md-10">
	<p>This activity is designed to get students thinking about what happens when air moves. Sometimes it is difficult to think about air and what it does because it is invisible. The vortex generator is a way to 'see' air as it interacts with objects within its 'blast zone'.</p>
	
	<p>Since air is hard to see, we rarely get to watch where it swirls, thickens or flows. Yet these things are incredibly important – since air creates friction with objects moving through it. It takes energy to push objects through the air, so we want to make the air as frictionless as possible. One way to do this is to make the air swirl in some places, creating something like an air ball-bearing.</p>

    <p>The shape of an object has a big influence on how air moves around it. Not only does it need to have a narrow nose to push the air aside, it also needs to create these swirling pockets of air in the right places to reduce drag and improve the object’s lift. Golf balls have dimples to make them fly further for this very reason – they create swirls of air to reduce the air friction.</p>

    <p>When testing an object for its air resistance, smoke is used with a wind chamber to be able to see the air’s movements and look at the places where vortices form. A vortex is a spinning flow of fluid or gas. Water going down the drain and the air in a tornado form vortices in the shape of funnels. The air cannon vortex is a doughnut shape or, mathematically, a torus. The air in the doughnut rolls from the centre to the edge. The air forms this shape because it leaves the cup at the centre of the hole is travelling faster than the air leaving around the edge of the hole. The air keeps its shape since the surrounding air is relatively slow moving (and under higher pressure). A good deal of the air shot by a cannon does blast straight out of the cannons as they fire. But some of the smoke gets dragged out and back by the edge of the ring out of which it was fired, and by contact with the outside air. It meets the air around it and starts curling backwards, looking like the edge of a mushroom cloud. The drag from the air and rim on one side, and the push from the smoke on the other, gets that patch of smoke to begin spinning, creating a vortex. The smoke still maintains some forward momentum, and so the ring travels across the room. If it weren't spinning, the friction of the air around it would cause it to break apart. Because it is spinning, it's moving faster than the air around it.</p>
