  <dd>Inks in markers are mixtures of different colours. You can see this by separating colours from markers into many colours on a wet coffee filter?</dd>

       <li>Cut along the two sides (see dotted lines in the picture) so that the coffee filter can open up. Do not cut the bottom of the filter.<br><img src="img/coffeefilter.png" width="25%"></li>
	   <li>Ask student to write down their name and grade along the left or right edge of the filter with a pencil. Do not out the name along the top edge of the filter as it will get covered by paint during the experiment.
       <li>Using different coloured markers, draw a caterpillar on the filter paper. Do not mark near the bottom of the filter paper.</li>
       <li>Place the bottom of the filter paper into a cup containing about a half-inch of water.</li>
       <li>When the water has reached the top of the paper, take the paper out of the cup, fold it open and place it flat on the drying table.</li>
       <li>Because the filter papers will be wet students will not get to take their creations home. Once they have dried the filter papers will be displayed as an art collage in the school.</li>

  <p>The inks in the markers appear to be a single colour, but they actually contain mixtures of several different colours. Some of the inks are more attracted to the paper, so they do not move when the water moves up the paper. Other inks are more attracted to the water (their more soluble), so they move with the water. This allows the separation of the mixture of inks in a pen, so you can see the different colours. It is called paper chromatography. There are also other forms of chromatography including liquid and gas chromatography. Chemists use chromatography to separate and identify mixtures.</p>
  
  <p>In this experiment, you're using a technique called chromatography. The name comes from the Greek words chroma and graph for "colour writing." The technique was developed in 1910 by Russian botanist Mikhail Tsvet. He used it for separating the pigments that made up plant dyes.</p>
  
  <p>There are many different types of chromatography. In all of them, a gas or liquid (like the water in  your experiment) flows through a stationary substance (like your coffee filter). Since different ingredients in a mixture are carried along at different rates, they end up in different places. By examining where all the ingredients ended up, scientists can figure out what was combined to make the mixture.</p>
  
  <p>Chromatography is one of the most valuable techniques biochemists have for separating mixtures. It can be used to determine the ingredients that make up a particular flavour or scent, to analyse the components of pollutants, to find traces of drugs in urine, and to separate blood proteins in various species of animals (a technique that's used to determine evolutionary relationships).</p>
