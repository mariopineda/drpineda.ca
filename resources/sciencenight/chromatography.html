       <li>Place the bottom of the filter paper into a cup containing about a half-inch of water.</li>
       <li>When the water has reached the top of the paper, take the paper out of the cup and dry it with a paper towel.</li>

  <dt>How does it work?</dt>
  <dd>The inks in the markers appear to be a single color, but they actually contain mixtures of several different colors. Some of the inks are more attracted to the paper, so they do not move when the water moves up the paper. Other inks are more attracted to the water (their more soluble), so they move with the water. This allows the separation of the mixture of inks in a pen, so you can see the different colors. It is called paper chromatography. There are also other forms of chromatography including liquid and gas chromatography. Chemists use chromatography to separate and identify mixtures.</dd>
