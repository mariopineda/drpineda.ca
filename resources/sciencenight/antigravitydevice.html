      <strong>Demo</strong>
	  <ol>
		<li>Demonstrate that the magnets work properly by touching it to various magnetic materials.</li>
		<li>Do the same thing with the regular washers to show the students that they are not magnetic.</li>
		<li>Take the regular washers and drop them from the height of your pipe (but not through the copper pipe).</li>
        <li>Ask students what they think will happen when you drop the regular washer through the copper pipe. You might want to show the students the pipe, in particular pointing out that there is nothing inside.</li>
		<li>Once the students have their predictions, drop the washer through the copper pipe to show that it falls through just as fast as when you dropped it without the pipe (as predicted).</li>
		<li>Take the magnet and drop them from the height of your pipe (but not through the copper pipe) onto something soft (or catch them).
		<li>Ask students what they think will happen when you drop the neodymium magnets through the copper pipe. If students think the magnets will get stuck to the pipe, show them that the pipe is not magnetic.</li> 
		<li>Once the students have their predictions, drop the magnets through the  pipe to demonstrate that they seem to defy gravity. What did students predict would happen? What happened? Why? In the preliminary time trials the washer you have been provided with for this experiment falls through the copper pipe in less than 2 seconds, one of the neodymium washers takes around 11 second to fall through the pipe and two neodymium washers struck together take about 20 seconds.</li> 
      </ol>	
	  
	  <strong>Hands on</strong>
	  <p>Offer students to drop the magnets through the copper pipe and catch them coming out at the bottom. In order to do this activity students will need to climb the step ladder to reach the top of the pipe.</p>

    <div class="col-md-2"><strong>Think about it</strong></div>
    <div class="col-md-10">
	  <ul>
        <li>Why did the magnets fall slower thorough copper pipe?</li>
        <li>Would this experiment work with a steel pipe? It would not work because steel is magnetic and the magnet would just get stuck.</li>
		<li>Would this experiment work with a plastic pipe? It would not work because plastic is not a conductor.</li> 
		<li>Why does it work with a copper pipe? Because copper is a non-magnetic conductor.</li>
		<li>Can you think of other non-magnetic conductors that can be used for this experiment? For example, aluminium (one could do this experiment with a roll of aluminium foil), silver and gold.

    <div class="col-md-2"><strong>How does it work</strong></div>
    <div class="col-md-10"> 
	   <p>Electromagnetism is a force responsible for a variety of things. It holds atoms together to form matter, which means you can’t fall through the floor or walk through a wall, but can push through water and air. It also happens to have a lot to do with how light is made, how electricity works and why magnets stick together or push apart.</p>

	   <p>As such, electricity and magnetism are related to one another. As electricity flows through a conductor, it creates a magnetic field, "pushing" in an counter-clockwise direction around the wire (if you imagine the negative electrons moving down the wire towards you).</p>

       <p>On the other hand, a moving magnet will also jiggle the charges in some materials, creating electricity. So a moving magnet makes electricity, which in turn creates another magnetic field.</p>

       <p>Our dropped magnet will not stick to the aluminium because aluminum is not magnetic. The only elements that can attract magnets are iron, nickel and cobalt. However, some metals, such as copper and aluminium, will still conduct electricity if a magnet is moved over it. As the magnet falls, it moves past the aluminium, making a small amount of electricity. This electricity creates its own tiny magnetic field that pushes up against the falling magnet, slowing it down.</p>

       <p>This is called "magnetic braking", which is quite useful in situations where normal brakes are not as effective. For instance, most mechanical brakes rely on friction. Yet if the surfaces are too smooth or covered in a lubricant such as water or oil, mechanical brakes can slip and fail. Many modern roller coaster cars therefore rely on magnetic brakes to slow them down.</p>

       <p>Some brakes are similar to the one in our experiment, relying on the movement of neodymium magnets to create what are called "eddy currents". The faster the magnets are moving, the stronger the eddy currents and the harder they’ll push, controlling the speed of the vehicle. Since they do not rely on an electrical supply and work in most environments, they are a reliable way to make sure your speeding roller coaster does not malfunction when you least want it to.</p>

    <div class="col-md-2"><strong>Safety & Concerns</strong></div>
    <div class="col-md-10">
	  <ul>
        <li>Neodymium magnets are extremely powerful. Take care not to put your fingers between the magnet and any other magnetic surface. Do not let the students play with the magnets.</li>
		<li>The magnets are brittle and can shatter if they fall onto a hard surface or if they snap together with another magnet or metal object with force. When you drop the magnets make sure that someone either catches them or that they land on something soft.</li>
		<li>To drop a magnet through the copper pipe or to watch the falling magnet students need to climb a step ladder. Make sure that they an adult (volunteer or parent) is at arms reach at all times.</li>
		<li>The copper pipe may have sharp edges.</li>
