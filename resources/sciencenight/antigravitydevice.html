       <li>Tie your magnet to the string, and swing it in a low circle so that it passes over a metal washer placed on a smooth surface. What happens to the Washer? Can you think of how this might be related to the other behavior you observed earlier?</li>

  <dt>How does it work?</dt>
  <dd>When you drop your magnet through a copper tube, it slows down. The magnet will also slide down the cookie sheet slowly, and nudge the metal washer in the direction the magnet is spinning. 
  
  Magnetic fields are the result of electric currents. Changing a magnetic field (moving a magnet) next to a non-magnetic metal will induce an electric field (a voltage difference) in the metal, which subsequently generates a magnetic field with an opposite orientation with respect to your magnet.

When your magnet moves next to a metal it creates these fields, but the fields act in a very specific way. They want to cancel out the magnetic field in the metal, because metals don’t like having electric or magnetic fields inside of them (that’s why electricity flows through metals easily—they’re trying to cancel out the difference in electric potential by moving electrons around!). This phenomenon is known as Lenz’s Law.

The magnetic field induced in the metal attracts the falling magnet, creating resistance. This resistance is what slowed down your magnet. As your magnet slows down, it stops generating as much current, which reduces the resistance acting on the magnet’s movement. Gravity speeds the magnet back up again until it reaches a happy medium speed. Basically, your magnet is creating a whirlpool of electrons around it as it falls through your pipe. Neat, huh?


The magnet moving near the copper causes a force that acts as a brake, slowing its natural motion down the pipe due to gravity. Where does the force come from?

Electric currents and magnetic fields are closely related. If you have one, you often have (or can make) the other.

The braking force in the demonstration is due to an eddy current. That's an electrical current that forms in the copper, in response to the moving magnetic field of the falling neodymium magnet.

That eddy current produces a magnetic field of its own. The two magnetic fields overlap and slow the fall of the magnet.

The science behind this braking force was described in the 19th century by physicist Heinrich Lenz who devised Lenz's law. Find more through the Go further web links top right.

	Neodymium magnets are very strong and should be handled with care since they can shatter at high velocities. Neodymium magnets of can pinch as they are attracted to other magnets or metals with great force & velocities.
	
	Neodymium magnets are surprisingly powerful when they snap towards metal or another magnet. Mind your fingers and don't let an animal or young child play with them.
	
	The magnets are quite brittle. Don't let them fall on to hard surfaces (like concrete) from a height – they may shatter into sharp pieces.
