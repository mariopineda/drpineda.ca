    <div class="col-md-10">
    This activity station is set up next to a wash room. Students may use the wash room for washing their hands after they are done with the activity. Do not pour large quantities of oobleck down the drain. Small amounts can be disposed in the drain but it has to be very diluted. A plastic pail with a lid is provided for disposing of large quantities of oobleck. If in doubt - use the pail.
  
    <h2>Set up</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Remove the entrance rug (roll it up and put to the side). Place several cut-up large garbage bags on the floor under the and table cover the table with the disposable plastic table cloth. Pre-make a pitcher of oobleck. Pour about one inch of the pre-made oobleck into several pie forms placed on the table.</li>
      <li>Pre-make oobleck by mixing one measure cornstarch to half-a-measure of water in large pitcher. Add a few drops of food colouring to the water. Any colour can be used but Dr. Seuss' oobleck is green. You may have to adjust the mixture with small amounts of cornstarch and/or water to reach the right consistency. To test it, poke hard with your finger, which should not sink in. Touch lightly and your sink should sink right in. Place a trash can with a large black garbage bag right next to the table. </li>
     <li>Make a few aprons from the large garbage bags (cut holes for the head and arms). Not all students will need an apron, but if they (or their parents) want them to wear one you will ave a few available. Unless the "aprons" are really messy with oobleck please reuse them. If they are really messy, just throw them out.</li>
    </ol>
  
    <h2>Demo</h2>
    <ol> 
      <li>Place two pie forms next to each other, one with oobleck and the other one with water.</li>
	  <li>Ask students what they know about liquids and solids. For example:</li>
	    <ul>
	      <li>A liquid can be poured.</li>
		  <li>A liquid takes the shape of the container it is in.</li>
		  <li>A solid can not be poured.</li>
		  <li>A solid has a fixed shape (or retains its shape).</li>
		  <li>One can blow bubbles into a liquid.</li>
	    </ul>
      <li>Contrast the properties of oobleck and a Newtonian fluid (water) by first trying to grab a fistful of water in your hand showing that now matter how hard you try to make a ball of water this is an impossible feat. Next demonstrated the properties of oobleck by grabbing a fistful of the gooey liquid and by applying force to it as you shape a ball out of it.  Open your hand and show the students how the oobleck immediately turns into a liquid again as it flows our between your fingers.</li>
      <li>Ask students what will happen if you slap the tray with water with the palm of your hand (do not actually do it!). Next ask students what they think will happen if you do the same thing to the tray with oobleck. After the students have their predictions, show them what happens by slapping your palm (quite hard) at the oobleck).</li>
    </ol>	
  
    <h2>Hands-on experiment</h2>
	<p>Ask students to roll up their sleeves.</p>
	
    <p>Ask students to explore the substance with their hands, popsicle stick, or a spoon, and to think of as many words as they can to describe it. Encourage students to explore freely. For example, they can blow bubbles into the oobleck using a straw. Students may also explore the oobleck with their hand, e.g. trying to make a ball out of it or slapping it with the palm of their hand.</p> 

    <p>Ask the students if oobleck is a liquid or a solid. If the students say solid, ask them to try to pour it. IF they say a liquid, ask them to try to roll it into a ball. Lead students to the realization than oobleck is interesting because it is both a solid and a liquid.</p>
	
	Ask students to try the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Ask students to place a popsicle stick or a finger in the oobleck and then take it out. What happened?</li>
	  <li>Poke the oobleck quickly. What happened?</li>
	  <li>Pick up some oobleck. How does it feel?</li>
	  <li>Try to roll the oobleck into a ball. What happened?</li>
	</ul>

    <div class="col-md-2"><strong>How does it work</strong></div>
    <div class="col-md-10">
      <p>Water and starch do something unusual when mixed together. The substance they form pours like a liquid, but when exposed to pressure (e.g. when squeezed by your hand), it instantaneously becomes a solid. When a substance acts like both a liquid and solid scientists call it a non-Newtonian fluid.</p>

      <p>Issac Newton stated individual liquids flow at consistent, predictable rates. As you likely discovered, cornstarch goo does not follow those rules – it can act almost like a solid, and them flow like a liquid. Technically speaking, the goo is a suspension, meaning that the grains of starch are not dissolved, they are just suspended and spread out in the water. If you let the goo sit for an while, the cornstarch would settle to the bottom of the bowl. So why does this concoction act the way it does? Most of it has to do with pressure. The size, shape, and makeup of the cornstarch grains causes the cornstarch to “lock-up” and hold its shape when pressure is applied to it. People have filled small pools with oobleck and they are able to walk across the surface of it (as long as they move quickly.) As soon as they stop walking, they begin to sink.</p>	  
  
      There are many examples of non-Newtonian fluids in the real world, e.g.
      <ul>
        <li>Sand in water</li>
		<li>Silly putty</li>
		<li>Chilled caramel topping</li>
		<li>Ketchup</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>This is a messy activity, please dress appropriately (i.e. your best clothes) and bring a lab coat if you have one. Large garbage bags will be available for use as aprons/lab coats for adults and kids that want to get close and personal with the oobleck.</li>
        <li>Do not pour the oobleck down the sink or toilet. Dispose of it in a garbage bag.</li>
        <li>Do not let students ingest the oobleck (e.g. when they blow bubbles with the straws).</li>
        <li>Do not let students share straws. Dispose of used straws immediately in the garbage bag.
