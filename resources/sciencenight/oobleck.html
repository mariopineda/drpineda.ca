    <div class="col-md-10">
    <p>This activity is set up next to a wash room for easy access to water and for students to wash their hands after the activity.</p>
	    
    <strong>Set up</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Remove the entrance rug (roll it up and put to the side). Place several cut-up large garbage bags on the floor under the table.</li>
      <li>Cover the table with the disposable table cloth.</li>
      <li>Pre-make a pitcher of oobleck by mixing one measure cornstarch to half-a-measure of water in large pitcher. Add a few drops of food colouring to the water. Any colour can be used but Dr. Seuss' oobleck is green. You may have to adjust the mixture with small amounts of cornstarch and/or water to reach the right consistency. To test it, poke hard with your finger, which should not sink in. Touch lightly and your sink should sink right in. Pour about one inch of the oobleck into several pie forms placed on the table.</li>
      <li>Place a trash can with a large black garbage bag right next to the table. </li>
      <li>Make a few aprons from the large garbage bags (cut holes for the head and arms). Not all students will need or want an apron, but if they (or their parents) want them to wear one you will have a few available. Unless the "aprons" are really messy with oobleck please reuse them. If they are really messy, just throw them out.</li>
    </ol>
  
    <strong>Demo</strong>
    <ol> 
      <li>Place two pie forms next to each other, one with oobleck and the other one with water.</li>
	  <li>Ask students what they know about liquids and solids. For example:</li>
	    <ul>
	      <li>A liquid can be poured.</li>
		  <li>A liquid takes the shape of the container it is in.</li>
		  <li>A solid can not be poured.</li>
		  <li>A solid has a fixed shape (or retains its shape).</li>
		  <li>One can blow bubbles into a liquid.</li>
	    </ul>
      <li>Contrast the properties of oobleck and a Newtonian fluid (water) by first trying to grab a fistful of water in your hand showing that now matter how hard you try to make a ball of water this is an impossible feat. Next demonstrated the properties of oobleck by grabbing a fistful of it and applying force as you shape it into a ball. Open your hand and show the students how the oobleck immediately turns into a liquid again as it flows our between your fingers.</li>
      <li>Ask students what will happen if you slap the tray with water with the palm of your hand (do not actually do it!). Next ask students what they think will happen if you do the same thing to the tray with oobleck. After the students have their predictions show them what happens by slapping your palm (quite hard) at the oobleck).</li>
    </ol>	
  
    <strong>Hands-on experiment</strong>
	  <ol>
	    <li>Ask students to roll up their sleeves.</li>
	    <li>Ask students to explore the substance with their hands, popsicle stick, or a spoon, and to think of as many words as they can to describe it. Encourage students to explore freely. For example, they can blow bubbles into the oobleck using a straw. Students may also explore the oobleck with their hand, e.g. trying to make a ball out of it or slapping it with the palm of their hand.</li> 
        <li>Ask the students if oobleck is a liquid or a solid. If the students say solid, ask them to try to pour it. If they say a liquid, ask them to try to roll it into a ball. Lead students to the realization than oobleck is interesting because it is both a solid and a liquid.</li>
	    <li>Ask students to try the following:
          <ul>
            <li>Ask students to place a popsicle stick or a finger in the oobleck, move it around slow and quick and then take it out. What happened?</li>
	        <li>Poke the oobleck quickly. What happened?</li>
	        <li>Pick up some oobleck. How does it feel?</li>
	        <li>Try to roll the oobleck into a ball. What happened?</li>
	      </ul>
		</li>
	  </ol>

    <div class="col-md-2"><strong>Think about it</strong></div>
    <div class="col-md-10">
	Ketchup is a non-Newtonian fluid. Ask students to think about how what they have learned about oobleck can be used to figure out the best strategy to get ketchup in a bottle to flow. Smacking the bottom of the bottle slows the ketchup flowing down as opposed to turning the bottle over and being patient.

    <div class="col-md-2"><strong>How does it work</strong></div>
    <div class="col-md-10">
      <p>Water and starch do something unusual when mixed together. The substance they form pours like a liquid, but when exposed to pressure (e.g. when squeezed by your hand), it instantaneously becomes a solid. When a substance acts like both a liquid and solid scientists call it a non-Newtonian fluid.</p>

      <p>Issac Newton stated individual liquids flow at consistent, predictable rates. As you likely discovered, cornstarch goo does not follow those rules – it can act almost like a solid, and them flow like a liquid. Technically speaking, the goo is a suspension (chemists call this type of mixture a colloid), meaning that the grains of starch are not dissolved, they are just suspended and spread out in the water. If you let the goo sit for an while, the cornstarch would settle to the bottom of the bowl. So why does this concoction act the way it does? Most of it has to do with pressure. The size, shape, and makeup of the cornstarch grains causes the cornstarch to “lock-up” and hold its shape when pressure is applied to it. People have filled small pools with oobleck and they are able to walk across the surface of it (as long as they move quickly.) As soon as they stop walking, they begin to sink.</p>	  
  
      <p>There are many examples of non-Newtonian fluids in the real world. They do not all behave like oobleck, but each one is weird in its own way. e.g. quicksand, beach sand at the water's edge, silly putty, chilled caramel topping and ketchup.</p>

    <div class="col-md-10">
      <ul>
        <li>This is a potentially messy activity and you might want to use a lab coat if you have one. Large garbage bags will be available for use as aprons/lab coats.</li>
		<li>Keep paper tissues at hand.</li>
        <li>Do not pour large quantities of oobleck down the drain. Small amounts can be disposed in the drain but has to be diluted. A plastic pail with a lid is provided for disposal of large quantities of oobleck. If in doubt - use the pail.</li>
        <li>Do not let students ingest the oobleck (e.g. when they blow bubbles with the straws).</li>
        <li>Do not let students share straws. Dispose of used straws immediately in the garbage bag.
