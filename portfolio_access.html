<p>To access my portfolio you need to authentication using a user name and password. To obtain the user name and password please <a href="{{ site.url}}/contact/">Contact Me</a>. Alternatively, if you already have my resume you can login by using the following approach:
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt>User name</dt>
<dd>My house number, e.g. if my address is 12345-12 Avenue, then 12345 is the user name you would use to login to my on-line portfolio.</dd>
<dt>Password</dt>
<dd>My phone number, e.g. if my phone number is (123) 456-7890, then 1234567890 is the password you would use to login to my on-line portfolio. </dd>
</dl>
