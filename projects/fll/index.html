<h1>We are The STEAMpunks!</h1>
<p>We are a rookie <em>FIRST LEGO</em> League (FLL) team based out of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. FLL is a robotics competition for children ages 9 to 14. Kids make a robot (from the <em>LEGO</em> Mindstorms EV3 kit) that can perform different challenges during the competition based on a theme. They also research a problem based on that theme, create a solution, and present it at the competition.  All the while they learn, practice and demonstrate values like being a good team member and a great sport. Check out our <a href="/projects/fll/first.html"><em>FIRST</em> page</a> for more info on what <em>FIRST</em> and FLL is.</p>

<p>This year's theme is entitled <a href="http://www.firstlegoleague.org/challenge/2014fllworldclass">WORLD CLASS</a> were teams explore the future of learning by redesigning how we gather knowledge and skills in the 21st century. Teams will teach adults about the ways that kids need and want to learn. - </p>

<p>Right now (from May 1, 2014) we are recruiting team members for the fall 2014. For more info check out our <a href="/projects/fll/team.html">Team page</a></p>
