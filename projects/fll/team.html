<h1>Who are we?</h1>
<p>We are the <em>The STEAMpunks</em> - an Edmonton-based rookie FLL team. We are currently recruiting team members for the 2014 FLL season WORLD CLASS.</p>

<h1>What's with the name, <em>The STEAMpunks</em>?</h1>
<p>Steampunk is a sub-genre of science fiction that typically features steam-powered machinery, especially in a setting inspired by industrialised Western civilisation during the 19th century. By a similar token, <em>The STEAMpunks</em> (with STEAM in caps) focuses on building future technology and engineering solutions featuring 21st century technology and science. Our team's approach embraces the excitement of hands-on learning using Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics - aka STEAM - to build tomorrow's solutions for today's challenges. We also happen to be huge fans of Jules Verne, the father of science fiction whose work epitomizes the awesomeness of steampunk. </p>

<p>We are <em>The STEAMpunks</em> - Building tomorrow's robots today!</p>
