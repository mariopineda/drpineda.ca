<h1>FAQ</h1>

<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>We are the <em>The STEAMpunks</em> - an Edmonton-based rookie FLL team. We are currently recruiting team members for the 2014 FLL season WORLD CLASS.</p>

<h2>What's with the name, <em>The STEAMpunks</em>?</h2>
<p>Steampunk is a sub-genre of science fiction that typically features steam-powered machinery, especially in a setting inspired by industrialised Western civilisation during the 19th century. By a similar token, <em>The STEAMpunks</em> (with STEAM in caps) focuses on building future technology and engineering solutions featuring 21st century technology and science. Our team's approach embraces the excitement of hands-on learning using Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics - aka STEAM - to build tomorrow's solutions for today's challenges. We also happen to be huge fans of Jules Verne, the father of science fiction whose work epitomizes the awesomeness of steampunk. </p>

<p>We are <em>The STEAMpunks</em> - Building tomorrow's robots today!</p>

<h2>Why joining us?</h2>
<p>The FLL program introduces younger students to real-world engineering challenges by building LEGO-based robots to complete tasks on a thematic playing surface. FLL teams, guided by their imaginations and adult coaches, discover exciting career possibilities and, through the process, learn to make positive contributions to society. Students participating in FLL teams get to:
<ul>
  <li>Design, build, test and program robots using <em>LEGO</em> Mindstorms technology
  <li>Apply real-world math and science concepts
  <li>Research challenges facing today’s scientists
  <li>Learn critical thinking, team-building and presentation skills 
  <li>Participate in tournaments and celebrations
</ul>
</p>

<p>What FLL teams accomplish is nothing short of amazing. It’s fun. It’s exciting. And the skills they learn will last a lifetime.</p>
