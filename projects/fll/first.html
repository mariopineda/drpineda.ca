<h2>Mission</h2>
<p><em>FIRST</em>'s mission is to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders, by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership.</p>

<p><em>FIRST</em> was founded in 1989 to inspire young people's interest and participation in science and technology. Based in Manchester, NH, the 501 (c) (3) not-for-profit public charity designs accessible, innovative programs that motivate young people to pursue education and career opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and math, while building self-confidence, knowledge, and life skills.</p>

<p>What is FLL?</p>
<o>The <em>FIRST LEGO League</em> (FLL) division of FIRST is a partnership between <em>FIRST</em> and the <em>LEGO</em> Company. FLL is a robotics competition for children aged 9-14. Through the competition, FLL introduces students to real-world engineering challenges by designing, building and testing LEGO-based robots to complete tasks on a thematic playing surface.</p>

<p>Using LEGO bricks, motors, sensors, and gears, teams gain hands-on experience in engineering and computer programming principles as they construct and program their unique robot inventions to fit each year’s challenge. Students also gain exposure to research challenges facing today’s scientists, through the team project they conduct. As part of the project, teams must identity a problem in their community 
that relates to the annual theme, research the problem and develop and innovative solution. 
Teams are guided by adult coaches, who help them discover exciting research topics and 
through the process make positive contributions to society.</p>
