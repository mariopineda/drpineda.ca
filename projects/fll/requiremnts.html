<h2>Requirements</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>Are you interested in science, technology, engineering, <em>LEGO</em>, robotics, and team work.</li>
	  <li>You are a team player. This is a team sport. If you are into individualist sports then this is not the program for you.</li>
	  <li>You are able to cover the cost of the program. The fee is payable up front and is non-refundable. The cost will range from $300 to $400 depending on the number of kids on the team (we run it at cost) and how much fundraising we are able to achieve.
	  </li>
	  <li>You are able to meet twice a week (Fridays 4-6) and Sundays (noon-2).</li>
	  <li>Parents willing and able to take on the necessary parent roles, i.e. volunteering, help with fund-raising, snack preparations and logistics during the tournament. During each meeting one parent needs to stay and assist with miscellaneous tasks.</li>
	  <li>You are able to make all the meetings. It's one thing to miss a meting if you are sick (which can happen to everyone), but it is a whole other thing to miss meetings because of other social obligations (e.g. other sports, vacation, church commitments, music classes, no one to bring you to and from meetings, etc.). If you suspect that you will be missing meetings because of the latter reasons this program is not for you. This is a team effort and the team relies on all its members attending all the meetings. Note that we will be meeting during the winder school break. These will be the last push before the tournament and it is very important that all team members attend these meetings. If you know (or even suspect) that you will be out of town during the winter school break then this program is not for you.</li>
