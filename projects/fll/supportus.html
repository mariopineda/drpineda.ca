<p>Do you want to support tomorrow's inventors, tinkerers, engineers and scientists today? <em>The STEAMpunks</em> are currently looking for sponsors for our 2014 competition season WORLD CLASS.</p>

<p>If you are interested in supporting us please <a href="/contact/">contact our Lead Coach Dr. Pineda</a>.</p>

<h3>Why sponsoring <em>The STEAMpunks</em>?</h3>
<p>Kids who participate in FIRST programs are:
<ul>
  <li> 50 percent more likely to attend college</li>
  <li>Twice as likely to major in science or engineering</li>
  <li>Three times as likely to major specifically in engineering</li>
  <li>Young women in FIRST programs are four times more likely to pursue science and engineering in college</li>
  <li>Minority members of FIRST teams are more than twice as likely to enter the fields of science and engineering</li>
</ul>

<h3>Budget</h3>
<p>The cost to run a FLL team is relatively modest, with several of the high-ticket items being one time costs. Specifically, once a team has a <em>LEGO</em> robotics kit (a Mindstorms kit), the field table and the necessary computer hardware (typically a laptop) these can be reused from year to year. As a rookie team are looking for <em>Founding Sponsors</em> for these items. Sponsors that will provide support (cash or in-kind) for reusable items (as indicated in the table below) will be acknowledged as <em>Founding Sponsors</em> on our web site, t-shirts and promotional material every year that <em>The STEAMpunks</em> participate in the FLL program.</p>
