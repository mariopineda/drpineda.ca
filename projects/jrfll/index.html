<p>I currently mentor two Junior FIRST LEGO League (JrFLL) based in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The community-based Allendale LEGO Kids and the school-based Progressive Academy LEGO Ninjagos. The JrFLL program is for children ages 6-9 and aims to capture young children's curiosity and directing it toward discovering the wonders of science and technology. This program features a real-world scientific concept to be explored through research, teamwork, construction, and imagination. Guided by adult Coaches, teams use LEGO to build a model that moves and develop a Show Me Poster to illustrate their journey.</p>
