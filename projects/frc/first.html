<h2>Mission</h2>
<p><em>FIRST</em>'s mission is to inspire young people to be science and technology leaders, by engaging them in exciting mentor-based programs that build science, engineering and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well-rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership.</p>

<p><em>FIRST</em> was founded in 1989 to inspire young people's interest and participation in science and technology. Based in Manchester, NH, the 501 (c) (3) not-for-profit public charity designs accessible, innovative programs that motivate young people to pursue education and career opportunities in science, technology, engineering, and math, while building self-confidence, knowledge, and life skills.</p>

<h2>FRC</h2>
<p>The highest level of robotics competition offered by <em>FIRST</em>. High school students team up with the world’s best technology companies to build the most impressive robots you’ve ever seen. Built from scratch in only 6 weeks, these 5 foot tall, 140 pound robots compete in high intensity robo-sports. With bragging rights at stake for schools and the companies that support them, robotics takes on a pro-sports experience. Watch the best of the best in robotics come out to play. “The varsity sport for the mind,” FRC combines the excitement of sport with the rigours of science and technology. Under strict rules, limited resources, and time limits, teams of 25 students or more are challenged to raise funds, design a team “brand,” hone teamwork skills, and build and program robots to perform prescribed tasks against a field of competitors. It’s as close to “real-world engineering” as a student can get. Volunteer professional mentors lend their time and talents to guide each team.</p>
