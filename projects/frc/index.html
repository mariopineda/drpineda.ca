<p>Opcom Robotics is an FRC Robotics team in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. We are a team that accepts high school students from any school in the Edmonton area.</p>

<p>FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is a unique varsity “Sport for the Mind” designed to help high-school-aged young people discover interesting and rewarding careers in engineering, science, and technology. FRC teams are composed of students, professional engineers, and other adult Mentors who have just six weeks to work collaboratively to design and build a robot that can compete in specially designed robot games. The challenge starts with a Kick-Off event in Calgary on January 2-3, followed by the 6 week build period culminating in the Western Canada Regional competition taking place at the Calgary Olympic Oval in April 2014.</p>

This is an incredible opportunity for youth to get involved with hands-on engineering and science, gaining practical experience in engineering, programming, project management, teamwork and problem solving, while having lots of fun. Students also have the opportunity to achieve high school credits by participating in this program. 

Any grade 9-12 students from Edmonton can apply to become student engineers on this Open Community Team.
