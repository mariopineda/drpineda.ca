<p>I mentor Team 5064, a <a href="first.html"><em>FIRST</em> Robotics Competition</a> team based in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The goal of Team 5064 is to continuously strive to actively improve ourselves and others by practising and promoting the Core Values of FIRST both in and out of competition..., oh, and we build awesome robots too. We work year round on improving our technical skills, team building, and promote personal development. Our team's motto is <em>Go FAST.</em></p>

<p>Where <em>FAST</em> stands for 
<ul>
  <li>Fast: as in the physical quantity velocity having both a speed and direction</li>
  <li>Agile: as in quickly, smartly and resourcefully responding to change</li>
  <li>Strong: as in having great physical strength and resilience</li>
  <li>Trained: as in mastering the necessary skills to excel</li>
</ul></p>

<p>We strive to <em>Go FAST</em>, continuously challenging ourselves to reach our, our team's and our robots full potential. We do not settle for easy solutions, we strive for <em>FAST</em> solutions.</p>

<p>We are recruiting team members, students and mentors, <em>right now</em>. See <a href="team.html">Team page</a> for more information.</p>
