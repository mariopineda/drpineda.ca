    <h3>What is robot sumo?</h3>
	<p>Robot sumo is a sport in which two robots attempt to push each other out of a circle (in a similar fashion to the sport of sumo). The robots used in this competition are called sumobots. Sumobots come in various classes, from heavy weight robots weighing as much as an adult to femto-sumo with tiny robots the size of a sugar cube.</p>
		
    <p>The most common robot sumo class are sumobots made out of LEGO Mindstorms components. This page is about the not so ancient sport of Mindstorms robot sumo; how to design, build and program LEGO Mindstorms sumobots, how to program them and how to play the game.</p>

    <h3>Sumobot specifications</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>A sumobot must be made entirely out of LEGO parts, with the only exceptions being the flag.</li>
      <li>A sumobot can only have one NXT or EV3 Mindstorms controlling it. The number of motors and sensors used are only limited by how many the brick support. NXT bricks support 3 motors and EV3 bricks support 4 motors. Both type of bricks support 4 sensors.</li>
      <li>The robot must fit inside a 10" x 10" square box (no height limit) when it is in it's starting configuration.</li>
      <li>The robot must be designed to wait five seconds, after the contestant presses a start button, before it moves.</li>
      <li>All actions must be pre-programmed. The use of any form of remote control is prohibited.</li>
      <li>The robot must not intentionally obstruct the control of the opponent’s operation or intentionally damage the opponent's robot or the the playing field.</li>

    <h3>Competition</h3>
	<p>A match consists of three games of up to three minutes each. The first sumobot winning two out of the three games is the winner of the match.</p>
	
	<h4>Beginning of the Game</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Before the game, the contestants greet each other outside the playing field following the chief referee's instructions, and then enter the playing field. The contestants can place their robot anywhere behind their starting line. No part of the robot can be in front of the starting line before the match begins.</li>
    <li>At the referee’s signal, the contestant start the program on their robot. The game begins five seconds after the referee’s signal. The contestants must exit the playing field during this 5 second period.</li>
    <li>Prior to the start of a match, the entire robot must fit inside a square box as defined for the weight class. At any time after the start of the match, the robot can expand outside these dimensions.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>End of the Game</h4>
    <ul>
	<li>The game ends when the referee calls the winner. Both contestants should thank each other for a fair and competitive match after removing their robots.</li>
    <li>A game will be stopped and a rematch will be started under the following conditions:</li>
    <ul>
	  <li>The robots are locked together in such a way that no more action appears to be possible, i.e. they have rotated in circles for 30 seconds or more.</li>
      <li>Both robots touch the exterior of the playing field at the same time.</li>
      <li>A robot breaks during the game.</li>
	  <li>Any other conditions under which the referee judges that no winner can be decided.</li>
      <li>In case of a rematch, maintenance of competing robots is prohibited, and the robots must be immediately placed in the designated starting position. The only exception to this rule is if the cause of the rematch is a robot breaking.</li>
      <li>If neither of the competing robots win, or lose, after a rematch, the referee may reposition both robots to a specified location and restart. If that does not yield a winner, the match may continue at any location decided by the referee, until the time limit is reached.</li>
	  <li>All decisions by the referee are final.</li>
	</ul>
  </ul>
	
  <h4>Violations</h4>
  A contestant (or a team) who takes any of the following actions will be disqualified from the game:
  <ul>
    <li>Competing with a robot that has not passed an inspection by the referee.</li>
    <li>A contestant does not attend the appointed playing field when called at the beginning of the game.</li>
    <li>A contestant entering or remains in the restricted zone around the sumo ring during the game.</li>
	<li>A contestant ruins the game, such as by intentionally breaking, damaging, or defacing the playing field or a robot.</li>
    <li>A contestant's robot does not meet the robot specifications.</li>
    <li>A contestant displays unsportsmanlike behaviour (this includes swearing or uttering profanities).</li>
