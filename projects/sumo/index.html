    <h3>What is robot sumo?</h3>
	<p>Robot sumo is a sport in which two robots attempt to push each other out of a circle (in a similar fashion to the sport of sumo). The robots used in this competition are called sumobots. Sumobots come in various classes, from heavy weight robots weighing as much as an adult to femto-sumo with tiny robots the size of a sugar cube.</p>
		
    <p>The most common robot sumo class, however, which is also what this page is about is where the sumobots are made out of LEGO Mindstorms components.</p>

    <h3>Competition</h3>
	<p>A match consists of three games of up to three minutes each. The first sumobot winning two out of the three games is the winner.</p>
	
	<h4>Beginning of the Game</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>Before the game, the contestants greet each other outside the playing field following the chief referee's instructions, and then enter the playing field. The contestants can place their robot anywhere behind their starting line. No part of the robot can be in front of the starting line before the match begins.</li>
    <li>At the referee’s signal, the contestant presses a single button on the NXT (usually the orange button). The game begins five seconds after the referee’s signal. The contestants must exit the playing field during this 5 second period.</li>
    <li>Prior to the start of a match, the entire robot must fit inside a square box as defined for the weight class. At any time after the start of the match, the robot can expand outside these dimensions.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>End of the Game</h4>
    <ul>
	<li>The game ends when the referee calls the winner. Both contestants should thank each other for a fair and competitive match after removing their robots.</li>
    <li>A Game will be stopped and a rematch will be started under the following conditions:</li>
    <ul>
	  <li>The robots are locked together in such a way that no more action appears to be possible, i.e. they have rotated in circles for 30 seconds or more.</li>
      <li>Both robots touch the exterior of the playing field at the same time.</li>
      <li>Any other conditions under which the referee judges that no winner can be decided.</li>
      <li>In case of a rematch, maintenance of competing robots is prohibited, and the robots must be immediately placed in the designated starting position.</li>
      <li>If neither of the competing robots win, or lose, after a rematch, the referee may reposition both robots to a specified location and restart. If that does not yield a winner, the match may continue at any location decided by the referee, until the time limit is reached.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Violations</h4>
	A contestant who takes any of the following actions will be disqualified from the game:
	<ul>
      <li>A contestant does not attend the appointed playing field when called at the beginning of the game.</li>
      <li>A contestant ruins the game, such as by intentionally breaking, damaging, or defacing the playing field.</li>
      <li>A contestant's robot does not meet the robot specifications.</li>
      <li>A contestant displays unsportsmanlike behavior.</li>
      <li>A contestant intentionally injures the opponent’s operator.</li>
	</ul>
